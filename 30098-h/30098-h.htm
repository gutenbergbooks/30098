<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Many visits to Venice have brought home
the fact that there exists, in English at least,
no work which deals as a whole with the
Venetian School and its masters. Biographical
catalogues there are in plenty, but these, though
useful for reference, say little to readers who are
not already acquainted with the painters whose
career and works are briefly recorded. &ldquo;Lives&rdquo;
of individual masters abound, but however excellent
and essential these may be to an advanced
study of the school, the volumes containing
them make too large a library to be easily
carried about, and a great deal of reading and
assimilation is required to set each painter in
his place in the long story. Crowe and Cavalcaselle&#8217;s
<em>History of Painting in North Italy</em> still
remains our sheet anchor; but it is lengthy, over
full of detail of minor painters, and lacks the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span>
interesting criticism which of late years has collected
round each master. There seems room
for a portable volume, making an attempt to
consider the Venetian painters, in relation to
one another, and to help the visitor not only
to trace the evolution of the school from its
dawn, through its full splendour and to its
declining rays, but to realise what the Venetian
School was, and what was the philosophy of
life which it represented.</p>

<p>Such a book does not pretend to vie with,
much less to supersede, the masterly treatises on
the subject which have from time to time
appeared, or to take the place of exhaustive
histories, such as that of Professor Leonello
Venturi on the Italian primitives. It should
but serve to pave the way to deeper and more
detailed reading. It does not aspire to give a
complete and comprehensive list of the painters;
some of the minor ones may not even be
mentioned. The mere inclusion of names, dates,
and facts would add unduly to the size of the
book, and, when without real bearing on
the course of Venetian art, would have little
significance. What the book does aim at is to
enable those who care for art, but may not have
mastered its history, to rear a framework on
which to found their own observations and appreciations;
to supply that coherent knowledge
which is beneficial even to a passing acquaintance
with beautiful things, and to place the unscientific
observer in a position to take greater advantage
of opportunities, and to achieve a wide and
interesting outlook on that cycle of artistic
apprehension which the Venetian School comprises,
and which marks it as the outcome and
the symbol of a great historic age.</p>

<p>The works cited have been principally those
with which the ordinary traveller is likely to
come into contact in the chief European galleries,
and, above all, in Venice itself. The lists do not
propose to be exhaustive, but merely indicate
the principal works of the artists. Those in
private galleries, unless easy of access or of first-rate
importance, are usually eliminated. It has
not been thought necessary to use profuse illustrations,
as the book is intended primarily for
use when visiting the original works.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>VENICE AND HER ART</strong></p>


<p>Venetian painting in its prime differs altogether
in character from that of every other part of
Italy. The Venetian is the most marked and
recognisable of all the schools; its singularity
is such that a novice in art can easily, in a
miscellaneous collection, sort out the works
belonging to it, and added to this unique character
is the position it occupies in the domain
of art. Venice alone of Italian States can boast
an epoch of art comparable in originality and
splendour to that of her great Florentine rival;
an epoch which is to be classed among the
great art manifestations of the world, which has
exerted, and continues to exert, incalculable
power over painting, and which is the inspiration
as well as the despair of those who try to
master its secret.</p>

<p>The other schools of Italy, with all their
superficial varieties of treatment and feeling,
depended for their very life upon the extent to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
which they were able to imbibe the Florentine
influence. Siena rejected that strength and
perished; Venice bided her time and suddenly
struck out on independent lines, achieving a
magnificent victory.</p>

<p>Art in Florence made a strictly logical
progress. As civilisation awoke in the old Latin
race, it went back in every domain of learning
to the rich subsoil which still underlay the ruin
and the alien structures left by the long barbaric
dominion, for the Italian in his darkest hour
had never been a barbarian; and as the mind was
once more roused to conscious life, Florence
entered readily upon that great intellectual
movement which she was destined to lead.
Her cast of thought was, from the first, realistic
and scientific. Its whole endeavour was to
know the truth, to weigh evidences, to elaborate
experiments, to see things as they really were;
and when she reached the point at which art was
ready to speak, we find that the governing motive
of her language was this same predilection for
reality, and it was with this meaning that her
typical artists found a voice. No artist ever
sought for truth, both physical and spiritual,
more resolutely than Giotto, and none ever spoke
more distinctly the mind of his age and country;
and as one generation follows another, art in
Tuscany becomes more and more closely allied
to the intellectual movement. The scientific
predilection for <em>form</em>, for the representation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of things as they really are, characterises not
Florentine painting alone, but the whole of
Florentine art. It is an art of contributions
and discoveries, marked, it is needless to say, at
every step by dominating personalities, positively
as well as relatively great, but with each member
consciously absorbed in &ldquo;going one better&rdquo; than
his predecessors, in solving problems and in
mastering methods. Florentine art is the outcome
of Florentine life and thought. It is part of
the definite clear-cut view of thought and reason,
of that exactitude of apprehension towards
which the whole Florentine mind was bent, and
the lesser tributaries, as they flowed towards
her, formed themselves on her pattern and
worked upon the same lines, so that they
have a certain general resemblance, and their
excellence is in proportion to the thoroughness
with which they have learned their lesson.</p>

<p>The difference which separates Venetian from
the rest of Italian painting is a fundamental one.
Venice attains to an equally distinguished place,
but the way in which she does it and the
character of her contribution are both so
absolutely distinct that her art seems to be the
outcome of another race, with alien temperament
and standards. Venice had, indeed, a history and
a life of her own. Her entire isolation, from her
foundation, gave her an independent government
and customs peculiar to herself, but at the same
time her people, even in their earliest and most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
precarious struggles, were no barbarians who
had slowly to acquire the arts of civilised life.
Among the refugees were persons of high birth
and great traditions, and they brought with them
to the first crazy settlement on the lagoons some
political training and some idea of how to reconstruct
their shattered social fabric. The Venetian
Republic rose rapidly to a position of influence
in Europe. Small and circumscribed as its area
was, every feature and sentiment was concentrated
and intensified. But one element above all permeates
it and sets it apart from other European
States. The Oriental element in Venice must
never be lost sight of if we wish to understand
her philosophy of art.</p>

<p>There are some grounds, seriously accepted
by the most recent historians, for believing that
the first Venetian colonists were the descendants
of emigrants who in prehistoric times had
established themselves in Asia and who had
returned from thence to Northern Italy. &ldquo;These
colonists,&rdquo; says Hazlitt, &ldquo;were called Tyrrhenians,
and from their settlements round the mouth of
the Po the Venetian stock was ultimately
derived.&rdquo; If the tradition has any truth, we
think with a deeper interest of that instinct for
commerce which seems to have been in the
very blood of the early Venetians. Did it,
indeed, come down to them from the merchants
of Tyre and Carthage? From that wonderful
trading race which stretched out its arms all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
over Europe and penetrated even to our own
island? From the first, Venice cut herself adrift,
as far as possible, from Western ties, but she
turned to Eastern people and to intercourse with
the East with a natural affinity which savours
of racial instinct. All her greatness was derived
from her Asiatic trade, and her bazaars, heaped
with Eastern riches, must have assumed a deeply
Oriental aspect. Her customs long retained
many details peculiar to the East. The people
observed a custom for choosing and dowering
brides, which was of Asia. The national
treatment of women was akin to that of an
Oriental State; Venetian women lived in a
retirement which recalled the life of the harem,
only appearing on great occasions to display their
brocades and jewels. Girls were closely veiled
when they passed through the streets. The
attachment of men to women had no intellectual
bias, scarcely any sentiment, but &ldquo;went
straight to the mark: the enjoyment of physical
beauty.&rdquo; The position of women in Venice was
a great contrast to that attained by the Florentine
lady of the Renaissance, who was highly educated,
deeply versed in men and in affairs, the fine flower
of culture, and the queen of a brilliant society.
The love for colour and gorgeous pageantry
was of Semitic intensity and seemed insatiable,
and the gratification of the senses was a
deliberate State policy. But passionate as was
the spirit of patriotism, enthusiastic the love and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
loyalty of the people, the civic spirit was absent.
The masses were contented to live under a despotic
rule and to be little despots in their own houses.
In the twelfth century the people saw power pass
into the hands of the aristocracy, and as long as
the despotism was a benevolent one, the event
aroused no opposition. Like Orientals, the
Venetians had wild outbursts, and like them
they quieted down and nothing came of them.
As Mr. Hazlitt remarks, &ldquo;their occasional
resistance to tyranny, though marked by deeds
of horrid and dark cruelty, left no deep or
enduring traces behind it. It established no
principle. It taught no lesson.&rdquo; Venice was a
Republic only in name. The whole aspect of
her government is Eastern. Its system of
espionage, its secret tribunals, its swift and
silent blows,&mdash;these are all Oriental traits, and
the East entering into her whole life from
without found a natural home awaiting it. We
should be mistaken, however, in thinking that
the Venetians in their great days were enervated
and lapped in the sensuality which we are apt to
associate with Eastern ideals. Sensuality did in
the end drain the life out of her. &ldquo;It is the
disease which attacks sensuousness, but it is not
the same thing.&rdquo; The Venetians were by nature
men with a deep capacity for feeling, and it is
this deep feeling which has so large a share in
Venetian art.</p>

<p>The painters of Venice were of the people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and had no wide intellectual outlook at its
most splendid moment, such as was possessed by
those men who in Florence were drawn into the
company of the Medici and their court of
scholars, and who all their lives were in the
midst of a society of large aims and a free public
spirit, in which men took their share of the
responsibilities and honours of a citizen&#8217;s life.
The merchant-patrons of Venice are quite uninterested
in the solving of problems. They
pay a price, and they want a good show of colour
and gilding for their money. Presently they
buy from outside, and a half-hearted imitation
of foreigners is the best ambition of Venetian
artists. Art, it has been said, does not declare
itself with true spontaneity till it feels behind it
the weight and unanimity of the whole body
of the people. That true outburst was long in
coming, but its seeds were fructifying deep in
a congenial soil. They were fostered by the
warmth and colour of Oriental intercourse, and
at last the racial instinct speaks with no uncertain
accent in the great domain of art, and
speaks in a new and unexpected way; as
splendid as, yet utterly unlike, the grand intellectual
declaration of Florence.</p>

<p>Let us bear in mind, then, that Venice in all
her history, in all her character, is Eastern
rather than Western. Hers is the kingdom of
feeling rather than that of thought, of emotion
as opposed to intellect. Her whole story tells
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of a profoundly emotional and sensuous apprehension
of the nature of things; and till the time
comes when her artists are inspired to express
that, their creations may be interesting enough,
but they fail to reveal the true workings of
her mind. When they do, they find a new
medium and use it in a new way. Venetian
colour, when it comes into its kingdom, speaks
for a whole people, sensuous and of deep feeling,
able for the first time to utter itself in art.</p>

<p>We have to divide the history of the
Venetian School into three parts. The first
extends from the primitives to the end of
Giovanni Bellini&#8217;s life. He forms a link
between the first and second periods. The
second begins with Giorgione and ends with
Tintoretto and Bassano, and is the Venetian
School proper. Thirdly, we have the eighteenth-century
revival, in which Tiepolo is the most
conspicuous figure, and which is in an equal
degree the expression of the life of its time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>PRIMITIVE ART IN VENICE</strong></p>


<p>The school of Byzantium, so widespread in its
influence, was particularly strong in Venice,
where mosaics adorned the cathedral of Torcello
from the ninth century and St. Mark&#8217;s became
a splendid storehouse of Byzantine art. The
earliest mosaic on the fa&ccedil;ade of St. Mark&#8217;s was
executed about the year 1250, those in the
Baptistery date during the reign of Andrea
Dandolo, who was Doge from 1342 to 1354.
Yet though the life of Giotto lies between these
two dates, and his frescoes at Padua were within
a few hours&#8217; journey, there is no sign that the
great revolution in painting, which was making
itself felt in every principal centre of Italy, had
touched the richest and most peaceful of all her
States.</p>

<p>Yet local art in Venice was no outcome of
Byzantinism. It rose as that of the mosaicists
fell, but its rise differs from that of Florence
and Siena in being for long almost imperceptible.
Artists were looked upon merely as artisans in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
all the cities of Italy, but in Venice before any
other city they had been placed among the
craftsmen. The statute of the Guild of Siena
was not formulated till 1355; that of Venice is
the earliest of which we have any record, and
bears the date of 1272. There is scarcely a
word to indicate that pictures in the modern
sense of the term existed. Painters were
employed on the adornment of arms and of
household furniture. Leather helmets and
shields were painted, and such banners as we
see in Paolo Uccello&#8217;s battlepieces. Painted
chests and <em>cassoni</em> were already in demand, dishes
and plates for the table and the surface of the
table itself were treated in a similar way.
Special regulations dealt with all these, and it
is only at the end of the list that ancon&aelig; are
mentioned. The ancona was a gilded framework,
having a compartment containing a
picture of the Madonna and Child, and others
with single figures of the saints, and these
were the only pictures proper produced at this
date. The demand for ancon&aelig; was, however,
large, and they were very early placed, not only
in the churches, but in the houses of patricians
and burghers. Constant disputes arose between
the painters and the gilders. Pictures were
habitually painted upon a gold ground, but
the painters were forbidden to gild the backgrounds
themselves. &ldquo;Gilding is the business
of the gilder, painting that of the painter,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
says a contemporary record. &ldquo;Now the gilder
contends that if a frame has to be gilt and
then touched with colour, he is entitled to
perform both operations, but the painter disputes
this right, and maintains that the gilder should
return it to him when the addition of painting
is desired.&rdquo; It was, however, finally decided by
law that each should exercise both professions,
when one or the other played a subordinate
part in the finished work. Though the art
of mosaic was falling into decay as painting
began to emerge, yet the commercial manufactory
of Byzantine Madonnas, which had been
established as early as 600, went on, on the Rialto,
without any variation of the traditional forms.</p>

<p>Florence very early discarded the temptation
to cling to material splendour, but as we pass
into the Hall of the Primitives in the Venetian
Academy, we see at once that Venetian art,
in its earlier stages, has more to do with the gilder
than the painter. The Holy Personages are
merely accessories to the gorgeous framework,
the embossed ornaments, the real jewels, which
were in favour with the rich and magnificent
patrons. There is no sign of any feeling for
painting as painting, no craving after the study
of form as the outcome of intellectual activity,
no zest of discovery, such as made the painter&#8217;s
life in Florence an excitement in which the
public shared. What little Venice imbibes of
these things is from outside influence, after due
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
lapse of time. A prosperous, luxurious city of
merchants and statesmen, she was too much
bound up in the transactions and sensations of
actual life to develop any abstract and thoughtful
ideals.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first painting we can discover
which shows any sign of independent effort is the
series which Paolo da Venezia painted on the back
of the Pala d&#8217; Oro, over the high altar of St. Mark,
when it was restored in the fourteenth century.
This reveals an artist with some pictorial aptitude
and one alive to the subjects that surround him.
It tells the story of St. Mark&#8217;s corpse transported
to Venice. The first panel contains a group of
cardinals of varying types and expressions; in
another the disciple listening to St. Mark&#8217;s teaching,
and crouching with his elbows on his knees,
has a true, natural touch. The dramatic feeling
here and there is considerable. The scene of the
guards watching the imprisoned Saint through
the window and seeing the shadow of two heads,
as the Saviour visits him, imparts a distinct
emotion; and there is force as well as feeling for
decorative composition in the panel in which the
Saint&#8217;s body lies at the feet of the sailors, while
his vision appears shining upon the sails.</p>

<p>Except for the exaggerated insistence on the
gilded elaborations of the early ancona, there is
not much to differentiate the early art of Venice
from that of other centres; but we notice that it
persevered longer in the material and mechanical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
art of the craftsman. Tuscan taste made little
impression, and many years elapsed before work
akin to that of Giotto attracted attention and was
admired and imitated. A man like Antonio
Veneziano met with the fate of the innovator in
Venice. He had too much of the simplicity of
the Tuscan and was compelled to carry his work
to Pisa, where his na&iuml;f and humorous narratives
still delight us in the Campo Santo. It was in
1384 that he was employed to finish the frescoes
of the life of S. Ranieri, which had been left uncompleted
at Andrea da Firenze&#8217;s death, and the
fondness for architecture and surroundings in the
Florentine taste, which secured him a welcome,
may, as Vasari says, be derived from Agnolo
Gaddi, who had already visited Padua and
Venice.</p>

<p>In the last years of the fourteenth century
tributary streams begin to feed the feeble main
current. In 1365 Guariento, a Paduan, was
employed by the State to paint a huge fresco of
Paradise in the Hall of the Gran Consiglio of
the Ducal Palace. This, which lay hid for
centuries under the painting by Tintoretto, was
uncovered in 1909 and found to be in fairly
good preservation. It can now be seen in a side
room. It tells us that Guariento had to some
extent been influenced by Giotto. The thrones
have long Gothic pendatives, the faces have more
the Giottesque than the Byzantine cast and show
that the old traditions were crumbling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
When painting in Venice first begins to
live a life of its own, Jacobello del Fiore stands
out as the most conspicuous of the indigenous
Venetians. His father had been president
of the Painters&#8217; Guild. Jacopo himself was
president from 1415 to 1436. He was a rich
and popular member of the State and a man
of high character. His works, to judge by the
specimens left, hardly attained the dignity of
art, though in the banner of &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; in the
Academy, the space is filled in a monumental
fashion and the figure of St. Gabriel with the
lily has something grand and graceful. We
trace the same treatment of flying banners and
draperies and rippling hair in the fantastic but
picturesque S. Grisogono in the left transept of
San Trovaso. Jacobello&#8217;s will, executed in 1439
in favour of his wife Lucia and his son, Ercole,
with provision for a possible posthumous son,
shows him to have been a man of considerable
possessions. He owned a slave and had other
servants, a house, money, and books. Among his
fellow-workers who are represented in Venice
are Niccolo Semitocolo, Niccolo di Pietro, and
Lorenzo Veneziano. The important altarpiece
by the last, in the Academy, has evidently
been reconstructed; two Eternal Fathers hover
over the Annunciation, and the Saints have
been restored to the framework in such wise
that the backs of many of them are turned
on the momentous central event. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
&ldquo;Marriage of St. Catherine,&rdquo; in the same
gallery, Lorenzo gets more natural. The Child,
in a light green dress with gold buttons, has a
lively expression, and looks round at His Mother
as if playing a game. The chapel of San Tarasio
in San Zaccaria contains an ancona of which the
central panel was only inserted in 1839, and is
identical with Lorenzo&#8217;s other work. One of
the finest and most elaborate of all the ancon&aelig; is
in San Giovanni in Bragora, and is also the work
of Lorenzo. In this, as well as in that of San
Tarasio, the Mother offers the Child the apple,
signifying the fruit of the Tree of Jesse and
symbolical of the Incarnation. This incident,
which is found thus early in art, was evidently
felt to raise the group of the Mother and Child
from a representation of a merely earthly relationship
to a spiritual scene of the deepest meaning
and the highest dignity.</p>

<p>Niccolo di Pietro has several early works of
the last decade of the fourteenth century, from
which we gather that he began as a Byzantine,
but that he imitated Guariento and was tentatively
drawn to the Giottesque movement, but
not, we may remember, before Giotto had been
dead for some sixty years. Niccolo di Pietro has
been confounded with Niccolo Semitocolo, but
it is now realised that they were two distinct
masters. The most important work of Michele
Giambono which has come down to us is the
signed ancona with five saints, now in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Venetian Academy. It is unusual to find a saint
in the central panel instead of the Madonna.
The saint is on a larger scale than his companions,
and has hitherto passed as the Redeemer,
but Professor Venturi has identified him as
St. James the Great. He has the gold scallop-shell
and pilgrim&#8217;s staff. It is clear from his size
and position that the ancona has been painted for
an altar specially dedicated to this Apostle.</p>

<p>The saints on the right are S. Michael and
S. Louis of Toulouse. Between S. John the Evangelist
and S. James is a monastic figure which
has evidently changed places with S. John
at some moment of restoration. If the two
figures are transposed, their attitudes become intelligible.
S. John is inculcating a message
inscribed in his open book, while the monk is
displaying his humble answer on his own page.
The use in it of the term <em>servus</em> suggests that
he is a Servite, though the want of the nimbus
precludes the idea that he is one of the founders.
It is probable that he is S. Filipo Benizzi, who,
though considered as a saint from the time of
his death, was not canonised for several centuries.</p>

<p>The Mond Collection includes a glowing
picture by Giambono; a seated figure clad in
rich vestments and holding an orb, probably
representing a &ldquo;Throne,&rdquo; one of the angelic
orders of the celestial
Hierarchy.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Works are still in existence which may be
ascribed to one or other of these masters, or
of which no attribution can be made, but we
know nothing positive of any other artists of the
time which preceded the influence of Gentile da
Fabriano. Nothing leads us to suppose that
the Venetian School in its origin had any pretension
to be a school of colour, or that it could
claim anything like real excellence at a time
when the Republic first became alive to the
movement which was going on in other parts of
Italy, and decided to call in foreign talent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>INFLUENCES OF UMBRIA AND VERONA</strong></p>


<p>Gentile da Fabriano, the Umbrian master,
when he reached Venice in the early years of
the fifteenth century, was already a man of note.
He had received his art education in Florence,
and he brought with him fresh and delicate
devices for the enrichment of painting with
gold, which, derived as it was from the Sienese
assimilation of Byzantine methods, was very
superior in fancy and refinement to anything
that Venice had to show. He was a man of a
gentle, mystic temperament, but he was accustomed
to courts, and a finished master whose
technique and artistic value was far beyond anything
that the local painters were capable of.
He spent some years in Venice, adorning the
great hall with episodes from the legend of
Barbarossa; one of these, which is specially
cited, was of the battle between the Emperor and
the Venetians. Gentile was working till about
1414, and the walls, finished by Pisanello, were
covered by 1416. After this Gentile remained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
some time in Bergamo and Brescia, and settled
in Florence about 1422. The year after reaching
Florence, he painted the famous &ldquo;Adoration
of the Magi,&rdquo; now in the Florentine Academy.
Even after leaving Venice his fame survived;
pictures went from his workshop in the Popolo
S. Trinit&agrave;, and he sent back two portraits after
he had returned to his native Fabriano.</p>

<p>We have no positive record of Gentile and
Vittore Pisano, commonly called Pisanello,
having met in Venice, but there is every
evidence in their work that they did so, and
that one overlapped the other in the paintings
for the Ducal Palace.</p>

<p>The School of Verona already had an honourable
record, and its Guild dates from 1303.
The following are its rules, the document of
which is still preserved, while that of Venice
has been lost:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Rules of the Veronese Guild</span> (<em>abridged</em>)</p>

<p>1. No one to become a member who had not
practised art for twelve years.</p>

<p>2. Twelve artists to be elected members.</p>

<p>3. The reception of a new member depends on his
being a senior.</p>

<p>4. The members are obliged in the winter season
to take upon themselves the instruction of
all the pupils in turn.</p>

<p>5. A member is liable to be expelled for theft.</p>

<p>6. Each member is bound to extend to another
fraternal assistance in necessity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
7. To maintain general agreement in any controversies.</p>

<p>8. To extend hospitality to strange artists.</p>

<p>9. To offer to one another reciprocal comfort.</p>

<p>10. To follow the funerals of members with
torches.</p>

<p>11. The President is to exercise reference authority.</p>

<p>12. The member who has the longest membership
to be President.</p></div>

<p>There were also by-laws, which provided
that no master should accept a pupil for less
than three years, and this acceptance had to
be definitely registered by the public notary, a
son, brother, grandson, or nephew being the
only exceptions. No master might receive
an apprentice who should have left another
master before his time was out, unless with that
master&#8217;s free consent. There were penalties for
enticing away a pupil, and others to be enforced
against pupils who broke the agreement. Severe
restrictions existed with regard to the sale of
pictures, no one but a member of the Guild
being allowed to sell them. No one might
bring a work from any foreign place for purposes
of sale. It might not even be brought
to the town without the special permission of
the <em>Gastaldiones</em>, or trustees of the Guild, and
those trustees were permitted to search for and
destroy forged pictures. Every painter, therefore,
had to subordinate his interests and inclinations
to the local school. It helps us to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
understand why the individual character of the
different masters is so perceptible, and one of
the primary causes of this must have been the
careful training of the pupils in the master&#8217;s
workshop.</p>

<p>The fresco left by Altichiero, Pisanello&#8217;s first
master, in the Church of S. Anastasia in Verona,
shows how worthily a Veronese painter was at
this early time following in the footsteps of
Giotto. Three knights of the Cavalli family
are presented by their patron saints to the
Madonna. The composition has a large simplicity,
a breadth of feeling which is carried
into each gesture. The knights with their
raised helmets, in the pattern of horses&#8217; heads,
are full of reality, the Madonna is sweet and
dignified, and the saints are grand and stately.
The picture has a delightful suavity and ease,
and the colouring has evidently been lovely.
The setting is in good proportion and more
satisfactory than that of the Giottesques. From
the series of frescoes in S. Antonio, Verona,
we gather that while Venice was still limited
to stiff ancon&aelig;, the Veronese masters were
managing crowds of figures and rendering distances
successfully. Altichiero puts in homely
touches from everyday life with a freedom
which shows he has not yet mastered the
principles of selection or the dignified fitness
which guided the great masters; as, for instance,
in the case of the old woman, among the spectators
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of the Crucifixion, who shows her grief by blowing
her nose. He lets himself be drawn off by all
manner of trivial detail and of gay costume; but
again in such frescoes as S. Lucia, or the &ldquo;Beheading
of St. George,&rdquo; in the Paduan chapel of the
Santo, he proves how well he understands the
force of solid, simply-draped figures, direct in
gesture and expression, while the decorative use
he makes of lances against the background was
long afterwards perhaps imitated, but hardly
surpassed, by Tintoretto.</p>

<p>Pisanello, who followed quickly upon
Altichiero and his assistant, Avanzi, exhibits
the same chivalresque and courtly inclinations
which commended Gentile da Fabriano to the
splendour-loving Venetians. Verona, under the
peaceful but gallant government of the Scaligeri,
had long been the home of all knightly
lore, and the artists had been employed to
decorate chapels for the families of the great
nobles. Among these, Pisanello had attained a
high place. Though very few of his paintings
remain, they all show these influences, and his
subtly modelled medals establish him as a
master of the most finished type. A much
destroyed fresco in S. Anastasia, Verona, portrays
the history of St. George and the Dragon.
In the St. George we probably see the portrait
of the great personage in whose honour the
fresco was painted. He is mounting his horse,
which, seen from behind, reminds us of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
fore-shortened chargers of Paolo Uccello. The
rescued princess, also a portrait, wears a magnificent
dress and an elaborate headgear in the
fashion of the day. Other horses, fiery and
spirited, are grouped around, and in the band of
cavaliers, beyond St. George, every head is
individualised; one is beautiful, another brutal,
and so on through the seven. A greyhound and
spaniel in the foreground are superbly painted,
the background is excellent, and a realistic touch
is given by the corpses which dangle unheeded
from the trees outside the castle-gate. A ruined,
but fortunately not restored, &ldquo;Annunciation&rdquo; in
S. Fermo, has a simple, slender figure of the
Virgin sitting by her white bed, and the angel,
with great sweeping, rushing wings and bowed,
child-like head with fair hair, is a most sweet
and keen figure, thrilling and convincing, in
contrast to all the dead, over-worked frescoes
round the church. All these paintings are too
small to be the least effective at the height at
which they are placed, and can only be seen
with a good glass. Pisanello&#8217;s art is not well
adapted to wide, frescoed walls, and he seems to
have enjoyed painting miniature panels, such as
the two we possess. In these he is full of
originality, and shows his love for the knightly
life, the life of courts, in the armed <em>cap-&agrave;-pied</em>
figure of St. George, whose point-device armour
is crowned by a wide Tuscan hat and feather.
The artist&#8217;s knowledge and love of animals and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
wild nature comes out in them, and his interest
in beauty and chivalry as opposed to the outworn
conventionalities of ecclesiastic demands.</p>

<p>We shall be able to trace the influence of
both the Umbrian and the Veronese painter
on men like Antonio di Murano and Jacopo
Bellini, and it is important to note the likeness
of the two to one another. In Gentile&#8217;s
&ldquo;Adoration&rdquo; we have on the one hand the
Holy Family and the gay pageant of the kings,
of which we could find the prototype in
many an Umbrian panel. On the other we see
those contrasting elements which were struggling
in Pisanello; the delight in flowers and animals,
in gaily apparelled figures, in dogs and horses.
The two have no lasting effect, but though they
created no actual school, they gave a stimulus to
Venetian art, and started it on a new tack,
enabling it to open its channels to fresh ideas.
During the time they were in Venice, Jacobello
del Fiore shows some signs of adapting the new
fashion to his early style, and the horse of
S. Grisogono is very like that of Gentile in
the &ldquo;Adoration,&rdquo; or like Pisano&#8217;s horses.
Michele Giambono is actually found in collaboration,
in the chapel of the Madonna da
Mascoli in St. Mark&#8217;s, with such a virile
painter as the Florentine, Andrea del Castagno,
who is evidently responsible for God the Father
and two of the Apostles; but Castagno must
have been thoroughly antipathetic to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Venetians, and though he may have taught
them the way to draw, he has not left any
traces of a following.</p>

<p>Facio, writing in 1455, speaks of Gentile&#8217;s
work in the Ducal Palace as already decaying,
while Pisanello&#8217;s was painted out by Alvise
Vivarini and Bellini.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE SCHOOL OF MURANO</strong></p>


<p>The important little town of Murano, a satellite
of Venice, lies upon an island, some ten minutes&#8217;
row from the mother State, distinct from which
it preserved separate interests and regulations.
Its glass manufacture was safeguarded by the
most stringent decrees, which forbade members
of the Guild to leave the islet under pain of
death. Its mosaics, stone work, and architecture
speak of an early artistic existence, and we
recognise the justice of the claim of Muranese
painters to be the first to strike out into a more
emancipated type than that of the primitives.
The painter Giovanni of Murano, called
Giovanni Alemanus or d&#8217; Alemagna, names
between which Venetian jealousy for a time
drew an imaginary distinction, had certainly
received his early education in Germany, and
betrays it by his heavier ornamentation and more
Gothic style; but he was a fellow-worker with
Antonio of Murano, the founder of the great
Vivarini family, and the Academy contains several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
large altarpieces in which they collaborated.
&ldquo;Christ and the Virgin in Glory&rdquo; was painted
for a church in Venice in 1440, and has an
inscription with both names on a banderol across
the foreground. The Eternal Father, with His
hands on the shoulders of the Mother and Son,
makes a group of which we find the origin in
Gentile da Fabriano&#8217;s altarpiece in the Brera,
and it is probable that one if not both masters
had been studying with the Umbrian and
absorbing the principles he had brought to
Venice. It is easy to trace the influence of
Giovanni d&#8217; Alemagna, though not always
easy to pick out which part of a picture
belongs to him and which to Antonio working
under his influence. In S. Pantaleone is
a &ldquo;Coronation of the Virgin,&rdquo; with Gothic
ornaments such as are not found in purely
Italian art at this period, but the example in
which both masters can be most closely followed
is the great picture in the Academy, the
&ldquo;Madonna enthroned,&rdquo; where she sits under
a baldaquin surrounded by saints. Here the
Gothic surroundings become very florid, and
have a gingerbread-cake effect, which Italian
taste would hardly have tolerated. Many
features are characteristic of the German; the
huge crown worn by the Mother, the floriated
ornament of the quadrangle, the almost baroque
appearance of the throne. Through it all,
heavily repainted as it is, shines the dawn of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the tender expression which came into Venetian
art with Gentile.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

<p class="caption"><em>Antonio da Murano.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ADORATION OF THE
MAGI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Berlin.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Hanfst&auml;ngl.</em>)</p>

<p>Giovanni d&#8217; Alemagna and Antonio da Murano
were no doubt widely employed, and when the
former died Antonio founded and carried on a
real school in Venice. In 1446 he was living in
the parish of S. Maria Formosa with his wife,
who was the daughter of a fruit merchant, and
the wills of both are still preserved in the parish
archives. Gentile da Fabriano had set the
example for gorgeous processions with gay dresses
and strange animals; winding paths in the background
and foreshortened limbs prove that attention
had been drawn to Paolo Uccello&#8217;s studies
in perspective, while many figures and horses
recall Pisanello. A striking proof of the sojourn
of Gentile and Pisanello in Venice is found in
an &ldquo;Adoration of Magi,&rdquo; now ascribed to
Antonio da Murano, in which the central group,
the oldest king kissing the Child&#8217;s foot, is very
like that in Gentile&#8217;s &ldquo;Adoration,&rdquo; but the foreshortened
horses and the attendants argue the
painter&#8217;s knowledge of Pisanello&#8217;s work. A comparison
of the architecture in the background
with that in the &ldquo;St. George&rdquo; in S. Anastasia
shows the same derivation, and the dainty cavalier,
who holds a flag and is in attendance on the
youngest king, is reminiscent of St. George and
St. Eustace in Pisanello&#8217;s paintings in the National
Gallery, so that in this one picture the influences
of the two artists are combined.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Antonio took his younger brother, Bartolommeo,
into partnership, and the title of da
Murano was presently dropped for the more
modern designation of Vivarini. Both brothers
are fine and delicate in work, but from the outset
of their collaboration the younger man is
more advanced and more full of the spirit of the
innovator. In his altarpiece in the first hall of
the Academy the Nativity has already a new
realism; Joseph leans his head upon his hand,
crushing up his cheek. The saints are particularly
vivid in expression, especially the old hermit
holding the bell, whose face is brimming with
ardent feeling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE PADUAN INFLUENCE</strong></p>


<p>And now into this dawning school, employed
chiefly in the service of the Church, with its
tentative and languid essays to understand
Florentine composition, resulting in what is
scarcely more than a mindless imitation, and
with its rather more intelligent perception of the
Humanist qualities of Pisanello&#8217;s work, there
enters a new factor; or rather a new agency
makes a slightly more successful attempt than
Gentile and Castagno had done to help the
Venetians to realise the supreme importance of
the human figure, its power in relation to other
objects to determine space, its modelling and
the significance of its attitude in conveying
movement. Giotto had been able to present all
these qualities in the human form, but he had
done so by the light of genius, and had never
formulated any sufficient rules for his followers&#8217;
guidance. In Ghiberti&#8217;s school, at the beginning
of the fifteenth century, the fascination of the
antique in art was making itself felt, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>Donatello had escaped from the artificial trammels
it threatened to exercise, and had carried
the Florentine school with him in his profound
researches into the human form itself.
Donatello had been working in Padua for ten
years before Pisanello&#8217;s death, and in an indirect
way the Venetians were experiencing some after-results
of the systematising and formulating of the
new pictorial elements. Though the intellectual
life had met with little encouragement among
the positive, practical inhabitants of Venice, in
Padua, which had been subject to her since 1405,
speculative thought and ideal studies were in
full swing. There was no re-birth in Venice,
whose tradition was unbroken and where &ldquo;men
were too genuinely pagan to care about the echo
of a paganism in the remote past.&rdquo; St. Mark
was the deity of Venice, and &ldquo;the other twelve
Apostles&rdquo; were only obscurely connected with
her religious life, which was strong and orthodox,
but untroubled by metaphysical enthusiasms and
inconvenient heresies. Padua, on the other hand,
was absorbed in questions of learning and
religion. A university had been established here
for two centuries. The abstract study of the
antique was carried on with fervour, and the
memory of Livy threw a lustre over the city
which had never quite died out. It seemed
perfectly right and respectable to the Venetians
that the <em>savants</em>, lying safely removed from the
busy stream of commercial life, should cultivate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>inquiries into theology and the classics, which
would only have been a hindrance to their own
practical business; but such, as it was well known,
were of absorbing interest in the circles which
gathered round the Medici in Florence. The
school of art, which was now arising in Padua,
was fed from such sources as these. The love of
the antique was becoming a fashion and a guiding
principle, and influenced the art of painting more
formally than it could succeed in doing among
the independent and original Florentines.</p>

<p>Francesco Squarcione, though, as Vasari says,
he may not have been the best of painters, has
left work (now at Berlin) which is accepted as
genuine and which shows that he was more
than the mere organiser he is sometimes called.
He had travelled in Greece, and was apparently
a dealer, supplying the demand for classic fragments,
which was becoming widespread. When
he founded his school in Padua he evidently
was its leading spirit and a powerful artistic influence.
His pupils, even the greatest, were
long in breaking away from his convention,
and few of them threw it off entirely, even in
after life. That convention was carried with
undeviating thoroughness into every detail.
Draperies are arranged in statuesque folds,
designed to display every turn of the form
beneath; the figures are moulded with all the
precision and limitations of statuary. The very
landscape becomes sculpturesque, and rocks of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>volcanic character are constructed with the
regularity of masonry. The colour and technique
are equally uncompromising, and the surface
becomes a beautiful enamel, unyielding, definite
in its lines, lacquer-like in its firmness of finish,
while the Gothic forms, which had hitherto been
so prevalent, were replaced by more or less
pedantic adaptations from Roman bas-reliefs.
This system of design was practised most
determinedly in Padua itself, but it soon spread
to Venice. Squarcione himself was employed
there after 1440, and though Antonio da Murano
clung to the old archaic style he saw the Paduan
manner invading his kingdom, and his own
brother became strongly Squarcionesque.</p>

<p>The two brothers of Murano come most
closely together in an altarpiece in the gallery of
Bologna, where the framework is more simple
than Alemanus&#8217;s German taste would have permitted,
and the Madonna and Child have some
natural ease, and the delicacy of feeling of primitive
art. Bartolommeo, when he breaks away and
sets out to paint by himself, is crude and strong, but
full of vital force. In his altarpiece of 1464, in
the Academy, he gives his saints reality by taking
them off their pedestals and making them stand
upon the ground, and though they are still
isolated from one another in the partitions of an
ancona, their sparkling eyes, individual features,
and curly beards give them a look of life. The
draperies, thin and clinging, with little rucked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>folds, which display the forms, and the drawing
of the bony structure, exaggerated in the arms
and legs, are Squarcionesque. The rocks and
stones, too, show the Paduan convention. In
several of his other altarpieces, Bartolommeo
introduces rich ornaments and swags of fruit,
such as Donatello had first brought to Padua,
or which Paduan artists delighted to copy from
classic columns. Antonio&#8217;s manner to the end
is the local Venetian manner, infused as it was
with the soft and charming influence of Gentile
da Fabriano and Pisanello, but Bartolommeo
adopts the new and more ambitious style.
Though not a very good painter, and inclined
to be puffy and shapeless in his flesh forms, he
was the head of a crowd of artists, and works of
his school, signed <em>Opus factum</em>, went all over
Italy, and are found as far south as Bari. Works
of his pupils are numerous; the &ldquo;St. Mark enthroned&rdquo;
in the Frari is as good if not better
than the master&#8217;s own work, and the triptych in
the Correr Museum is a free imitation.</p>

<p>Round this early school gathered such
painters as Antonio da Negroponte and Quirizio
da Murano, who were both working in 1450.
Negroponte has left an enthroned Madonna in
S. Francesco della Vigna, which is one of the
most beautiful examples of colour and of the
fanciful charm of the Renaissance that the early
art of Venice has to show. The Mother and
Child are placed in a marble shrine, adorned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>with antique reliefs, rich wreaths of fruit swag
above her head, a little Gothic loggia is full
of flowers and fruit, and birds are perched on
cornucopias. On either side, four badly drawn
little angels, with ugly faces and awkwardly
foreshortened forms, foreshadow the beautiful,
music-making angels which became such a
feature of North Italian art. The Divine
Mother, adoring the Child lying across her
knees, has an exquisite, pensive face, conceived
with all the delicacy and simplicity of early art.
It seems quite possible, as Professor Leonello
Venturi suggests, that we have here the early
master of Crivelli, in whom we find the love
of fruit garlands, of chains of beads and rich
brocades carried to its farthest limits, who takes
keen pleasure in introducing the ugly but lively
little angels, and who gives the same pensive and
almost mincing expression to his Madonnas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>JACOPO BELLINI</strong></p>


<p>While Venice was assimilating the spirit of the
school of Squarcione, which in the next few
years was to be rendered famous by Mantegna,
another influence was asserting itself, which was
sufficient to counteract the hard formalism of
Paduan methods.</p>

<p>When Gentile da Fabriano left Venice, he
carried with him, and presently established with
him in Florence, a young man, Jacopo Bellini,
who had already been working with him and
Pisanello, and who was an ardent disciple of the
new naturalistic and humanist movement. Both
Gentile and his apprentice were subjected to annoyance
from the time they arrived in Florence,
where the strict regulations which governed the
Guilds made it very difficult for any newcomer
to practise his art. The records of a police case
report that on the 11th of June 1423 some
young men, among them, one, Bernabo di San
Silvestri, the son of a notary, were observed
throwing stones into the painter&#8217;s room. His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>assistant, Jacopo Bellini, came out and drove the
assailants away with blows, but Bernabo, accusing
Jacopo of assault, the latter was committed to
prison in default of payment. After six months&#8217;
imprisonment, a compromise of the fine and a
penitential declaration set him at liberty. The
accounts declare that Gentile took no steps to
be of service to his follower; but Jacopo soon
after married a girl from Pesaro, and his first
son was christened after his old master, which
does not look as though they were on unfriendly
terms. Jacopo travelled in the Romagna, and
was much esteemed by the Estes of Ferrara,
but he was back in Venice in 1430. He has
left us only three signed works, and one or two
more have lately been attributed to him, but
they give very little idea of what an important
master he was.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Jacopo Bellini.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGONY IN GARDEN&mdash;DRAWING.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>British Museum.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p>His Madonna in the Academy has a round,
simple type of face, and in the Louvre Madonna,
which is attributed but not signed, it is easy to
recognise the same arched eyebrows and half-shut,
curved eyelids. In this picture, where the
Madonna blesses the kneeling Leonello d&#8217; Este, we
see how Pisanello acted on Jacopo and, through
him, on Venetian art. The connection between
the two masters has been established in a very
interesting way by Professor Antonio Venturi&#8217;s
discovery of a sonnet, written in 1441, which
recounts how they painted rival portraits of
Leonello, and how Bellini made so lively a likeness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>that he was adjudged the first place. The
landscape in the Louvre picture is advanced in
treatment, and with its gilded mountain-tops, its
stag and its town upon the hill-side, is full of
reminiscences of Pisanello, especially of the &ldquo;St.
George&rdquo; in S. Anastasia. We come upon such
traces, too, in Jacopo&#8217;s drawings, and it is by
his two sketch-books that we can best judge of
his greatness. One of these is in the British
Museum; the other, in the Louvre, was discovered
not many years ago in the granary of a
castle in Guyenne. These drawings reveal Jacopo
as one of the greatest masters of his day. He is
larger, simpler, and more natural than Pisanello,
and he apparently cares less for the human figure
than for elaborate backgrounds and surroundings.
Many of his designs we shall refer to again when
we come to speak of his two sons. His &ldquo;Supper
of Herod&rdquo; reminds us of Masolino&#8217;s fresco at
Castiglione d&#8217; Olona. He sketches designs for
numbers of religious scenes, treated in an original
and interesting manner. A &ldquo;Crucifixion&rdquo; has
bands of soldiers ranged on either side, an
&ldquo;Adoration of the Magi&rdquo; has a string of camels
coming down the hill, the executioners in a
&ldquo;Scourging&rdquo; wear Eastern head-dresses. In a
sketch for a &ldquo;Baptism of Christ&rdquo; tall angels
hold the garments in the early traditional way;
on one side two play the lute and the violin,
while the two on the other side have a trumpet
and an organ. He has sketches for the Ascension,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Resurrection, Circumcision, and Entombment,
repeated over and over again with variations,
and one of S. Bernardino preaching in Venice
(where he was in 1427). Jacopo delights even
more in fanciful and mythological than in sacred
subjects. A tournament with spectators, a Faun
riding a lion, a &ldquo;Triumph of Bacchus&rdquo; with
panthers, are among such essays. The fauns
pipe, the wine-god bears a vase of fruit. His
love of animals is equal to that of Pisanello,
and S. Hubert and the stag with the crucifix
between its horns is directly reminiscent of the
Veronese. His horses, of which there are
immense numbers, sometimes look as if copied
from ancient bas-reliefs. His treatment of
single nude figures is often poor and weak
enough, and his rocks have the flat-topped,
geological formation of the Paduan School, but
no one who so drank in every description of
lively scene about him could have been in any
danger of becoming a mere archeological type,
and it was from this pitfall that he rescued
Mantegna. To judge by his drawings, Jacopo
did not overlook any source of art open to him;
he delights in the rich research of the Paduans as
much as in the varieties of wild nature and all
the incidents of contemporary life first annexed
by Pisanello. He is often very like Gentile da
Fabriano, he makes raids into Uccello&#8217;s domains
of perspective, he is frankly mundane and draws
a revel of satyrs and centaurs with a real interpretation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>of the lyrical and pagan spirit of the
Greeks, and he has an idealism of the soul,
which found its full expression in his son,
Giovanni. We cannot call Jacopo Bellini the
founder of the Venetian School, for its makings
existed already, but it was his influence on
his sons which, above all, was accountable for
the development of early excellence. His long,
flowing lines have a sweep and a fanciful grace
which form an absolute antidote to the definite,
geometrical Paduan convention. In Jacopo we
see the thorough assimilation of those foreign
elements which were in sympathy with the
Venetian atmosphere, and while up to now
Venice had only imbibed influences, she was
soon to create for herself an artistic <em>milieu</em>
and to become the leader of the movement of
painting in the north of Italy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>CARLO CRIVELLI</strong></p>


<p>We must turn aside from the main stream when
we come to speak of Carlo Crivelli, who,
important master as he was, occupies a place
by himself. A pupil of the Vivarini and perhaps,
as we have noted, of Antonio Negroponte,
Crivelli was profoundly influenced by the
Paduans, from whom he learned that metallic,
finished quality of paint which he carried to
perfection. Crivelli shows intellect, individuality,
even genius, in the way in which he grapples
with his medium and produces his own reading,
and the circumstances of his life were such as to
throw him in upon himself and to preserve his
originality. His little early &ldquo;Madonna and
Child&rdquo; at Verona is linked with that of Negroponte
by the elaborate festoons, strings of beads,
and large-patterned brocades used in the surroundings,
and has those ugly, foreshortened
little <em>putti</em>, holding the instruments of the
Passion, of the type elaborated by Squarcione
and Marco Zoppo, and which, in their improved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>state, we are accustomed to think of as
Mantegnesque.</p>

<p>When Crivelli was thirty-eight years old, he
was condemned to six months&#8217; imprisonment and
to a fine of two hundred lire for an outrage on
a neighbour&#8217;s wife. Perhaps it was to escape
from an unenviable reputation that he left Venice
soon after and set up painting in the Marches,
where he lived from 1468 to 1473. He then
went on to Camerino in Umbria, where his great
triptych, now in the Brera, was painted, and a
few years later he was in Ascoli, with a commission
for an Annunciation in the Cathedral.
This is the picture now in the National Gallery,
in which the Bishop holds a model of the
Duomo. After 1490 he worked in little towns
in the Marches, and is not mentioned after 1493.
He does not seem ever to have come back to
Venice.</p>

<p>Shut up in the Marches, where there was
little strong local talent, and where he could not
keep up with the progress that was taking place
in Venice, he was obliged himself to supply the
artistic movement. He kept the Squarcionesque
traditions to the end, but moulded them by his
own love of rich and exuberant decoration. Moreover,
he was of a very intense religious bias, and
this finds a deeply touching and mystical expression,
more especially in his Piet&agrave;s. The love
of gilded patterns and fanciful detail was deep-seated
in all the Umbrian country. His altarpieces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>were intended as sumptuous additions to
rich churches, and were consequently arranged,
with many divisions, in the old Muranese manner.
His great ancona, in the National Gallery, is a
marvel of elaborate ornament and enamel-like
painting. The Madonna is delicate, almost
affected in her refinement. Her long fingers
hold the Child&#8217;s garment with the extreme of
dainty precision, the croziers and rings of the
saints and bishops are embossed with gold and
real jewels. The flowers in the panel of &ldquo;The
Immaculate Conception,&rdquo; which hangs beside it,
are twisted into heads of mythological beasts and
grotesques or cherubs; but Crivelli has plenty
of strength, and his male saints have vigorous,
bony limbs and fierce fanatical eyes. It is, however,
in his colour that he charms us most, and
though he does not touch the real fount, he
is of all the earlier school the most remarkable
for subtle tender tones and lovely harmonies of
olive-greens and faded rose and cream embossed
with gold.</p>

<p>Crivelli continued executing one great ancona
after another, limiting his progress to perfecting
his technique, and his influence was most deeply
felt by such Umbrian painters as Lorenzo di San
Severino and Niccola Alunno. The honours paid
him testify to the reputation he acquired. He
was created a knight and presented with a golden
laurel wreath. But though he never, that we can
hear of, revisited his native State, he always adds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span><em>Venetus</em> to the signature on his paintings, a fact
which tells us that far from Venice and in
provincial districts, her prestige was felt and
gave his work an enhanced commercial value.
He had no after-influence upon the Venetian
School, and in this respect is interesting as
an example of the tenacity exercised by the
Squarcionesque methods, when, unchecked by
any counter-attraction, they came to act upon a
very different temperament; for in his love of
grace and beauty and of rich effects, and especially
in his intensity of mystic feeling, Crivelli is a
true Venetian and has no natural affinity with
the classic spirit of the Paduans.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>GENTILE BELLINI AND ANTONELLO DA MESSINA</strong></p>


<p>What, then, is the position which art has
achieved in Venice a decade after the middle of
the fourteenth century, and how does she compare
with the Florentine School? The Florentines,
Fra Angelico, Andrea del Castagno, and
Pesellino were lately dead. Antonio Pollaiuolo
was in his prime, Fra Lippo was fifty-four,
Paolo Uccello was sixty-three. But though the
progress in the north had been slower, art both
in Padua and Venice was now in vigorous progress.
Bartolommeo Vivarini was still painting
and gathering round him a numerous band of
followers; Mantegna was thirty, had just completed
the frescoes in the Eremitani Chapel and
the famous altarpiece in S. Zeno; and Gentile
and Giovanni Bellini were two and four years
his seniors.</p>

<p>Francesco Negro, writing in the early years
of the sixteenth century, speaks of Gentile as the
elder son of Jacopo Bellini. Giovanni is thought
to have been an illegitimate son, as Jacopo&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>widow only mentions Gentile and another son,
Niccolo, in her will. There is every reason to
believe that, as was natural, the two brothers were
the pupils and assistants of their father. A
&ldquo;Madonna&rdquo; in the Mond Collection, the
earliest known of Gentile&#8217;s works, shows him
imitating his father&#8217;s style; but when his sister,
Niccolosia, married Mantegna in 1453, it is not
surprising to find him following Mantegna&#8217;s
methods for a time, and a fresco of St. Mark
in the Scuola di San Marco, an important commission
which he received in 1466, is taken
direct from Mantegna&#8217;s fresco at Padua.</p>

<p>As the Bellini matured, they abandoned the
Squarcionesque tradition and evolved a style of
their own; Gentile as much as his even more
famous brother. Gentile is the first chronicler
of the men and manners of his time. In 1460 he
settled in Venice, and was appointed to paint the
organ doors in St. Mark&#8217;s. These large saints,
especially the St. Mark, still recall the Paduan
period. They have festoons of grapes and apples
hung from the architectural ornaments, and the
cast of drapery, showing the form beneath,
reminds us of Mantegna&#8217;s figures. But Gentile
soon becomes an illustrator and portrait painter.
Much of his work was done in the Scuola of
St. Mark, where his father had painted, and this
was destroyed by fire in 1485. Early, too, is the
fine austere portrait of Lorenzo Giustiniani, in
the Academy. In 1479 an emissary from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Sultan Mehemet arrived in Venice and requested
the Signoria to recommend a good painter and
a man clever at portraits. Gentile was chosen,
and departed in September for Constantinople.
He painted many subjects for the private apartments
of the Sultan, as well as the famous
portrait now in the possession of Lady Layard.
It would be difficult for a historic portrait to
show more insight into character. The face is
cold, weary, and sensual, with all the over-refined
look of an old race and a long civilisation,
and has a melancholy note in its distant
and satiated gaze. The Sultan showed Gentile
every mark of favour, loaded him with presents,
and bestowed on him the title of Bey. He
returned home in 1493, bringing with him
many sketches of Eastern personages and the
picture, now in the Louvre, representing the
reception of a Venetian Embassy by the Grand
Vizier. Some five years before Gentile&#8217;s commission
to Constantinople Antonello da Messina
had arrived in Venice, and the spread and
popularisation of oil-painting had hastened the
casting off of outworn ecclesiastical methods and
brought the painters nearer to the truth of life.
Antonello did not actually introduce oils to the
notice of Venetian painters, for Bartolommeo
Vivarini was already using them in 1473, but
he was well known by reputation before he
arrived, and having probably come into contact
with Flemish painters in Naples, he had had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>better opportunities of seizing upon the new
technique, and was able to establish it both in
Milan and in Venice. A large number of
Venetians were at this time resident in Messina:
the families of Lombardo, Gradenigo, Contarini,
Bembo, Morosini, and Foscarini were among those
who had members settled there. Many of these
were patrons of art, and probably paved the way
to Antonello&#8217;s reception in Venice. At first all
the traits of Antonello&#8217;s early work are Flemish:
the full mantles, white linen caps and tuckers, the
straight sharp folds and long wings of the angels
have much of Van Eyck, but when he gets to
Venice in 1475, its colour and life fascinate him,
and a great change comes over his work. His
portraits show that he grasped a new intensity
of life, and let us into the character of the men
he saw around him. His &ldquo;Condottiere,&rdquo; in the
Louvre, declares the artist&#8217;s recognition of that
truculent and formidable being, full of aristocratic
disdain, the product of a daring, unscrupulous
life. The &ldquo;Portrait of a Humanist,&rdquo; in
the Castello in Milan, is classic in its deepest
sense; and in the Trivulzio College at Milan an
older man looks at us out of sly, expressive eyes,
with characteristic eyebrows and kindly, half-cynical
mouth. It was not wonderful that these
portraits, combined with the new medium,
worked upon Gentile&#8217;s imagination and determined
his bent.</p>

<p>The first examples of great canvases, illustrating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>and celebrating their own pageants, must
have mightily pleased the Venetians. Scenes in
the style of the reception of the Venetian
ambassadors were called for on all hands, and
when the excellence of Gentile&#8217;s portraits was
recognised, he became the model for all Venice.
When his own and his father&#8217;s and brother&#8217;s
paintings perished by fire in 1485, he offered
to replace them &ldquo;quicker than was humanly
possible&rdquo; and at a very low price. Giovanni,
who had been engaged on the external decorations,
was ill at the time, but the Signoria was
so pleased with the offer that it was decided to
let no one touch the work till the two brothers
were able to finish it. Gentile still painted
religious altarpieces with the Virgin and Child
enthroned with saints, but most of his time was
devoted to the production of his great canvases.
Some of these have disappeared, but the &ldquo;Procession&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Miracle of the Cross,&rdquo; commissioned
by the school of S. Giovanni Evangelista,
are now in the Academy, and the third canvas,
executed for the same school, &ldquo;St. Mark preaching
at Alexandria,&rdquo; which was unfinished at the
time of his death, and was completed by his
brother, is in the Brera.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</div>
<p class="caption"><em>Gentile Bellini.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROCESSION OF THE HOLY CROSS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Venice.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p>These great compositions of crowds bring
back for us the Venice of Gentile&#8217;s day as no
verbal description can do. There is no especial
richness of colour; the light is that of broad day
in the Piazza and among the luminous waterways
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>of the city. We can see the scene any day
now in the wide square, making allowance for
the difference of costume. The groups are set
about in the ample space, with the wonderful
cathedral as a background. St. Mark&#8217;s has been
painted hundreds of times, but no one has ever
given such a good idea of it as Gentile&mdash;of its
stateliness and beauty, of its wealth of detail; and
he does so without detracting from the general
effect, for St. Mark&#8217;s, though the keynote of the
whole composition, is kept subservient, and is
part of the stage on which the scene is enacted.
The procession passes along, carrying the relics,
attended by the waxlights and the banners.
Behind the reliquary kneels the merchant,
Jacopo Sal&ograve;, petitioning for the recovery of his
wounded son. Then come the musicians; the
spectators crowd round, they strain forward to
see the chief part of the cort&egrave;ge, as a crowd
naturally does. Some watch with reverence,
others smile or have a negligent air. The faces
of the candle-bearers are very like those we
may see to-day in a great Church procession:
some absorbed in their task, or uplifted by inner
thoughts; others looking curiously and sceptically
at the crowd. Gentile tries in his crowds
to bring together all the types of life in Venice,
all the officials and the ecclesiastical world, the
young and old. With a few strokes he creates
the individual and also the type;&mdash;the careless
rover; the responsible magistrate; the shrewd,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>practical man of business; the young men, full
of their own plans, but pausing to look on at
one of the great religious sights of their city.
In the &ldquo;Finding of the Cross&rdquo; he produces the
effect of the whole city <em>en f&ecirc;te</em>. It was a sight
which often met his eyes. The Doge made no
fewer than thirty-six processions annually to
various churches of the city, and on fourteen of
these occasions he was accompanied by the whole
of the nobles dressed in their State robes. Every
event of importance was seized on by the Venetian
ladies as an opportunity for arraying themselves
in the richest attire, cloth of gold and velvet,
plumes and jewels. Gentile has massed the ladies
of Queen Catherine Cornaro&#8217;s Court around their
Queen upon the left side of the canal. The
light from above streams upon the keeper of the
School, who holds the sacred relic on high. All
round are the old, irregular Venetian houses, and
in the crowd he paints the variety of men he
saw around him every day in Venice. Yet even
in this animated scene he retains his old quattrocento
calm. The groups are decorously assisting:
only here and there he is drawn off to some
small detail of reality, such as an oarsman
dexterously turning his boat, or the maid letting
the negro servant pass out to take a header into
the canal. The spectators look on coolly at one
more of the oft-seen, miraculous events. The
committee, kneeling at the side, is a row of
unforgettable portraits, grave, benign, sour, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>austere, with bald head or flowing hair. In this
composition he triumphs over all difficulties of
perspective; our eye follows the canals, and the
boats pass away under the bridge in atmospheric
light. All the joy of Venice is in that play of
light on broad brick surfaces, light which is
cast up from the water and dances and shimmers
on the marble fa&ccedil;ades.</p>

<p>Gentile made his will in 1502, as well as
others in 1505 and 1506. He left word that he
was to be buried in SS. Giovanni e Paolo, and
begged his brother Giovanni to finish the work
in the Scuola, in return for which he is to receive
their father&#8217;s sketch-book. The unfinished piece
is the &ldquo;St. Mark preaching at Alexandria,&rdquo; and
it shows Gentile still developing his capacity as a
painter. It is pale in colour but brilliant in sunlight.

of the Turkish women is cleverly subdued
so as not to detract from the effect of the sunlight.
The thronged effect of the great square is studied
with more than his usual care, and the faces have
all the old individuality. The foremost figures in
the crowd have a colour and richness which we
may attribute to Giovanni&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Gentile was always fully employed, and the
detailed paintings of functions became very
popular; but he was a far less modern painter
than his brother, and, in fact, they represent
two distinct artistic generations, though Gentile&#8217;s
work was so much the most elaborate and, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>the quattrocento would have thought, the most
ambitious.</p>

<p>Gentile is essentially the historic painter, yet
his is a grave, sincere art, and he has an unerring
instinct for the right incidents to include. He
cuts out all unseemly trivialities, his actors are
stern, powerful men, the treatment is historic
and contemporary, but not gossipy. We realise
the look of the Venice of his day, in all its tide
of human nature, but we also feel that he never
forgot that he was chronicling the doings of a
city of strong men, and that he must paint them,
even in their hours of relaxation and emotion, so
as to convey the real dignity and power which
underlay all the events of the Republic.</p>

<p>We gather from his will and that of his wife
that they had no children, which perhaps makes
the more natural the affectionate terms upon
which he remained all through his life with
his brother. Their artistic sympathies must
have differed widely. Gentile&#8217;s love for historical
research, for costume and for pageants, found
no echo in the deeper idealism of Giovanni&mdash;indeed,
his offer of the famous sketch-book, as an
inducement to the latter to finish his last great
work, seems to hint that it was an exercise out
of his brother&#8217;s line; but he knew that Giovanni
was a great painter, and did not trust it, as we
might have expected, to his assistants, Giovanni
Mansueti and Girolamo da Santacroce.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>ALVISE VIVARINI</strong></p>


<p>Contemporary with Giovanni Bellini were
artists still firmly attached to the past, who were
far from suspecting that he was to outstrip them.</p>

<p>One of Antonio de Murano&#8217;s sons, Luigi or
Alvise Vivarini, grew up to follow his father&#8217;s
profession, and was enrolled in the school of his
uncle, Bartolommeo. The latter being an enthusiastic
follower of Squarcione, Alvise was at
first trained in Paduan principles. Jacopo Bellini&#8217;s
efforts had done something to counteract the
hard, statuesque Paduan manner, and had rendered
Mantegna&#8217;s art more human and less stony,
but Jacopo could not prevent Squarcionesque
painters from importing into Venice the style
which he disliked so much. Bartolommeo threw
in his lot with the Paduans, and his school, especially
when reinforced by Alvise, maintained
its reputation as long as it only had to compete
with local talent. The Vivarinis had now been
firmly established in Venice for two generations,
and were the best-known and most popular of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>her painters. Albert D&uuml;rer, on his first visit,
admired them more than the Bellini. When,
however, Gentile and his brother set up in
Venice, a hot rivalry arose between them and
the old Muranese School. The Bellini had come
with their father from Padua, with all its new
and scientific fashions. They had all the prestige
of relationship with Mantegna, and they shared
the patronage of his powerful employers. The
striking historical compositions of Gentile were
at once in demand by the great confraternities.
Bartolommeo had never been very successful in
his dealing with oil-painting, though he had
dabbled in it for some years before Antonello da
Messina came his way, but the perception with
which the Bellini at once grasped the new
technique gave them the victory. We have
only to compare the formless contours of much
of Bartolommeo Vivarini&#8217;s work, the bladder-like
flesh-painting of the Holy Child, with the
clear luminous colour and firm delicate touch of
Gentile, to see that the one man is leagues ahead
of the other.</p>

<p>Alvise Vivarini had more natural affinity
with his father than with his uncle. He
never becomes so exaggerated in his forms as
Bartolommeo. The expression of his faces is
much deeper and more inward, and he has something
of the devotional sweetness of early art.
His first known work is an ancona of 1475 at
Montefiorentino, in a lonely Franciscan monastery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>on the spurs of the Apennines. In the centre of
the five panels the Madonna sits with her hands
pressed palm to palm, in adoration of the Child
asleep across her knees. The painter here follows
the tradition of his father and uncle, especially
in the Bologna altarpiece, in which they
collaborated in 1450. Four saints stand on
either side, framed in Gothic panels; it is all in
the old way, and it is only by degrees that we
see there is more sweetness in the expression,
better modelling in the figures, and a slenderer,
more graceful outline than the earlier ancon&aelig;
can show. Only five years after this ancona at
Montefiorentino, with its stiff rows of isolated
saints, we have the altarpiece in the Academy
&ldquo;of 1480,&rdquo; which was painted for a church in
Treviso, and here a great change is immediately
apparent. The antiquated division into panels
has disappeared, nothing is left of the artificial,
Squarcionesque decorations, the attitudes are
simple, and the scene is a united one. The
Madonna&#8217;s outstretched hand, the suggestion of
&ldquo;Ecce Agnus Dei,&rdquo; makes an appeal which
draws the attention of all the saints to one point,
and it is made plain that the one idea pervades
the entire assembly. The curtain, which
symbolises the sanctuary, still hangs behind the
throne, but the gold background is abandoned.
Alvise has not indeed, as yet, imagined any landscape
or constructed an interior, but he lightens
the effect by two arched windows which let in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>sky. The forms are characteristic of his idea of
drawing the human figure; they have the long
thighs with the knees low down, which we
are accustomed to find, and he constructs a
very fine and sharply contrasted scheme of light
and shade. There is no trace of the statuesque
Paduan draperies. The Virgin&#8217;s brocaded
mantle is simply draped, and the robes of the
saints hang in long straight folds. No doubt
Alvise, though nominally the rival of the Bellini,
has more affinity with them, particularly with
Giovanni, than with the Paduan artists, and as
time goes on it is evident that he paints with
many glances at what they were doing. In the
altarpiece in Berlin he constructs an elaborate
cupola above the Virgin, such as Bellini was
already using. His saints are full of movement.
In the end he begins to attitudinise and to display
those artificial graces which were presently
accentuated by Lotto.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption"><em>Alvise Vivarini.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALTARPIECE OF 1480.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Venice.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p>In 1488 the two Bellini had for some time
been employed in the Sala del Gran Consiglio
by the Council of Ten. Alvise, with his busy
school, had hoped, but hitherto in vain, to be
invited to enter into competition with them.
At length he wrote the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">To the Most Serene the Prince and the Most
Excellent Signoria</span>&mdash;I am Alvise of Murano, a
faithful servant of your Serenity and of this most
illustrious State. I have long been anxious to exercise
my skill before your Sublimity and prove that continued
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>study and labour on my part have not been useless.
Therefore offer, as a humble subject, in honour and
praise of that celebrated city, to devote myself, without
return of payment or reward, to the duty of producing
a canvas in the
<ins class="translit" title="Possibly should be Sala del Gran Consiglio">Sala del Gran Consiio</ins>,
according to the
method at present in use by the two brothers Bellinii,
and I ask no more for the said canvas than that I should
be allowed the expenses of the cloth and colours as well
as the wages of the journeymen, in the manner that has
been granted to the said Bellinii. When I have done I
shall leave to your Serenity of his goodness to give me in
his wisdom the price which shall be adjudged to be just,
honest, and appropriate, in return for the labour, which
I shall be enabled, I trust, to continue to the universal
satisfaction of your Serenity and of all the excellent
Government, to the grace of which I most heartily
commend myself.</p></div>

<p>The &ldquo;method at present in use&rdquo; was presumably
the oil-painting established by Antonello,
which was now being made use of to replace
the decorations in fresco and tempera which
Guariento, Pisanello, and Gentile da Fabriano
had executed, and which were constantly decaying
and suffering from the sea air and the dampness
of the climate. The Council accepted
Alvise&#8217;s offer with little delay, and he was told to
paint a picture for a space hitherto occupied by
one of Pisanello&#8217;s, and was given a salary of sixty
ducats a year, something less than that drawn
by Giovanni Bellini. Unfortunately his work,
scenes from the history of Barbarossa, perished
in the great fire of 1577.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p><p>Venice is rich in works which show us what
sort of painter was at the head of the Muranese
School at the time when it rivalled that of the
Bellini. Alvise has two reading saints on either
side of the altarpiece of 1480, and of these the
Baptist is one of his best figures, &ldquo;admirably
expressive of tension and of brooding thought.&rdquo;
It is large and free in stroke, and particularly
advanced in the treatment of the foliage. Close
by hangs a character-study of St. Clare; type
of a strenuous, fanatical old woman, one which
belongs not only to the period, but will be
recognised by every student of human nature.
Formidable and even cruel is her unflinching
gaze; she is such a figure as might have stood
for Scott&#8217;s Prioress, and looks as little likely to
show mercy to an erring member of her order.
In contrast, there is the exquisite little &ldquo;Madonna
and Child&rdquo; with the two baby angels, still
shown as a Bellini in the sacristy of the
Church of the Redentore. It is the most
absolutely simple and direct picture of the kind
painted in Venice. The baby life is more perfect
than anything that Gian. Bellini produced,
and if much less intellectual than his Madonnas,
there is all the tender charm of the primitives,
combined with a freedom of drapery and a
softness of form which could not be surpassed.
The two little angels are more mundane in
spirit than those of the school of Bellini; they
have nothing of the mystical quality, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>we are reminded of Bellini, and the painting
is an exercise in his manner. In the sacristy
of San Giobbe is an early Annunciation, which
is now definitely assigned to Alvise. It has the
old tender sentiment, and the carnations of its
draperies are of a lovely tint. The priests of
S. Giovanni in Bragora were great patrons of
the school of the Vivarini, for here, besides
several works by Bartolommeo and his assistants,
is a little Madonna in a side chapel, which may
be compared with the Redentore picture. The
Mother sits inside a room, with the Child lying
across her knees in the same pose. The two
arched openings in the background of the 1480
altarpiece have become windows, through which
we look out on a charming landscape of lake and
mountain. In the same church a &ldquo;Resurrection&rdquo;
is not to be overlooked. It was executed in
1498, and some of the grace and beauty of the
sixteenth century has crept into it. Against the
pink flush of dawn stands the swaying figure of
the risen Christ, and below appear the heads of
the two guards, looking up, surprised and joyful.
It is perhaps the very earliest example of that
soft and sensuous feeling, that rhapsody of
sensation which was presently to sweep like a
flood over the art of Venice. &ldquo;What a time
must the dawn of the sixteenth century have been
when a man of seventy, and not the most vigorous
and advanced of his age, had the freshness and
youthful courage to greet it; nay, actually to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>depict its magic and glamour as Alvise does in
the &lsquo;Resurrection&rsquo;! Giorgione is here anticipated
in the roundness and softness of the figures,
and in the effect of light. Titian&#8217;s Assunta is
foreshadowed in the fervour of the guards&#8217;
expressions.&rdquo; Alvise, if he never thoroughly
mastered the structure of the nude, and if his
forms keep throughout some touch of the
archaic, some awkwardness in the thickness
of the figures, with their round heads, long
thighs, and uncertain proportions, is yet extraordinarily
refined and tender in sentiment, his
line has a natural flow and beauty, and the
heads of his Madonnas and saints cannot be
surpassed in loveliness.</p>

<p>His death came when the noble altarpiece to
St. Ambrogio in the Frari was still unfinished,
and it was completed by his assistant, Marco
Basaiti. The execution is heavy and probably
of Basaiti, but the venerable doctor is a grand
figure, and the two young soldier saints on his
right and left hand are striking examples of
the beauty we claim for him. The architectural
plan is very elaborate, but altogether successful.
The group is set beneath an arched vault
supported by columns and cornices. Overhead,
behind a balustrade, is placed a coronation of
the Virgin. The many figures are grouped so
as not to interfere with each other, and the
sword of St. George, the crozier of St. Gregory,
and the crook of St. Ambrose break up the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>composition and give length and line. The
faces of the saints are extremely beautiful,
and the two angels making music below
compare well with those of the Bellinesque
School.</p>

<p>The portraits Alvise has left add to his
reputation, and remind us of those of Antonello
da Messina, particularly in the vital expression
of the eyes, though they are without Antonello&#8217;s
intense force. The &ldquo;Bernardo di Salla&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Man feeding a Hawk,&rdquo; though some critics
still ascribe them to Savoldo, have features which
make their attribution to Alvise almost certainly
correct. Indeed, the resemblance of
Bernardo to the Madonna in the 1480 altarpiece
cannot escape the most unscientific observer.
There is the same inflated nostril, the peculiarly
curved mouth, and vivacious eyes.</p>

<p>Among the followers of Alvise, Marco
Basaiti, Bartolommeo Montagna, and Lorenzo
Lotto are the most distinguished. Others less
direct are Giovanni Buonconsiglio and Francesco
Bonsignori, while Cima da Conegliano was for
a short time his greatest pupil. We shall return
to these later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>CARPACCIO</strong></p>


<p>Vittore Carpaccio was Gentile Bellini&#8217;s most
faithful pupil. He and his master stand apart
in having, before the arrival of the Venetian
School proper, captured an aspect and a charm
inspired by the natural beauty of the City of
the Sea. Gentile, as we have seen, paints her
historic appearance, and Carpaccio gives us
something of the delight we feel to-day in her
translucent waters and her ample, sea-washed
spaces flooded with limpid light. While
others were absorbed in assimilating extraneous
influences, he goes on his own way, painting,
indeed, the scenes that were asked for, but
painting them in his own manner and with his
own enjoyment.</p>

<p>Pageant-pictures had been the demand of the
Venetian State from very early days. The
first use of painting had been that made by the
Church to glorify religion, and very soon the
State had followed, using it to enhance the love
which Venetians bore to their city, and to bring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>home to them the consciousness of its greatness
and glory. Pageants and processions were an
integral part of Venetian life. The people
looked on at them, often as they occurred, with
more pride and sense of proprietorship than a
Londoner does at a coronation procession or at
the King going in state to open Parliament. The
Venetian loved splendour and beauty and the
story of the city&#8217;s great achievements, and
nothing provided so welcome a subject for the
decoration of the great public halls as portrayals
of the events which had made Venice famous.
Artists had been employed to produce these as
early as the end of the fourteenth century, and
those of the Bellini and Alvise Vivarini (which
perished in the great fire) were a rendering on
modern lines of the same subjects, satisfying the
more advanced feeling for truth and beauty.</p>

<p>Besides the Church and the public Government,
we have already seen the &ldquo;Schools,&rdquo; as
they were called, becoming important employers.
These schools were the great organised confraternities
in the cause of charity and mutual
help, which sprang up in Venice in the fifteenth
century. That of St. Mark was naturally the
foremost, but others were banded each under
their patron saint. Each attracted numbers of
rich patrons, for it was the fashion to belong
to the confraternities. Riches and endowments
rolled in, and halls for meeting and for transacting
business were built, and were adorned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>with pictures setting forth the legends of their
patron saints. We have already seen Gentile
Bellini employed in the schools of San Marco
and San Giovanni, and now the schools of St.
Ursula and St. George gave commissions to
Carpaccio, or perhaps it would be more correct
to say that Gentile, having become pre-eminent
in this art, provided employment for his pupil
and assistant, and that by degrees Carpaccio
became a <em>maestro</em> on his own account.</p>

<p>A host of second-rate painters were plying
side by side, disciples first of one master, then
drawn off to become followers of a second;
assimilating the influence first of one workshop
and then of another. Carpaccio has been lately
identified as a pupil of Lazzaro Bastiani, who
had a school in Venice, and the recent attribution
to this painter of the &ldquo;Doge before the
Madonna,&rdquo; in the National Gallery, gives some
countenance to the contention that he was held
to be of great excellence in his time.</p>

<p>Though some historians advance the suggestion
that Carpaccio was a native of Capo
d&#8217;Istria, there is little proof that he was not,
like his father Pietro, born a Venetian. He
seems to have worked in Venice all his life,
his first work being dated 1490 and his last
1520. In 1527 his wife, Laura, declared herself
a widow.</p>

<p>The narrative art needed by the confraternities
was supplied in perfection by Carpaccio,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>and one of his earliest independent commissions
was the important one of decorating the School
of St. Ursula. Devotion to St. Ursula was a
monopoly of the school. No one else had
a right to collect offerings in her name or to
put up an image to her. The legend afforded
an opportunity for painting varied and dramatic
scenes, of which Carpaccio takes full advantage,
and the cycle is one of the freshest and most
characteristic things that has come down to us
from the quattrocento. Problems are not conspicuous.
The mediocre masters who have
educated the painter have made little impression
on him. He is entirely occupied in delight in
his subject and in telling his story. The story
of St. Ursula, told briefly, is that she was the
daughter of the King of Brittany. The King
of England sends his ambassadors to beg her
hand for his son, Hereo. Ursula discusses the
proposal with her father, and makes the conditions
that Hereo, who is a heathen, shall be
baptized, and that the betrothed couple must
before marriage visit the Pope and the sacred
shrines. After taking leave of their parents, the
Prince and Princess depart on their expedition,
but Ursula has had a vision in her sleep in
which an angel has announced her martyrdom.
She is accompanied on her journey by 11,000
virgins, and they are received by Pope Cyriacus
in Rome. The Pope then makes the return
journey with them as far as Cologne, where,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
however, they are assaulted and massacred by
the Huns, after which Ursula is accorded a
splendid funeral, and is canonised. The thirteen
scenes in which the story is told are arranged
on nine canvases, and the painter has not executed
them in the chronological order, some
of the latest events being the least complete in
artistic skill. Professor Leonello Venturi assigns
the following dates to the list:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The ambassadors of the King of England meet
those of the King of Brittany to ask for the hand of
Ursula. Probably painted from 1496-98.</p>

<p>2. (On same canvas) Ursula discusses the proposal
with her father. 1496-98.</p>

<p>3. The King of Brittany dismisses the ambassadors.
1496-98.</p>

<p>4. The ambassadors return to the King of England.
1496-98.</p>

<p>5. An angel appears to Ursula in her sleep. 1492.</p>

<p>6, 7, 8. The betrothed couple take leave of their
respective parents, and the Prince meets Ursula. 1495.</p>

<p>9. The betrothed couple and the 11,000 virgins
meet the Pope. 1492.</p>

<p>10. They arrive at Cologne. 1490.</p>

<p>11, 12. The massacre by the Huns. The Funeral.
1495.</p>

<p>13. The saint appears in glory, with the palm of
martyrdom, venerated by the 11,000 virgins and received
in heaven by the Eternal Father. 1491.</p></div>

<p>No. 10 is a small canvas, such as might
naturally have been chosen for a first experiment.
The heads are large with coarse features, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>the proportions of the figures are poor. The
face of the saint in glory (No. 13), plump and
without much expression, is of the type of
Bastiani&#8217;s saints. It may be assumed that such
a great scheme of decoration would not have
been entrusted to any one who was not already
well known as an independent master, but
perhaps Carpaccio, who would have been about
thirty when the work was begun, was still principally
engrossed with the conventional, ecclesiastical
subject. The heads of the virgins pressing
round the saint appear to be portraits, and were
very possibly those of the wives and daughters
of members of the confraternity.</p>

<p>The improvement that takes place is so rapid
that we can guess how congenial the painter
found the task and how quickly he adapted his
already trained talent. In No. 5 he takes
delight in the opportunity for painting a little
domestic scene,&mdash;the bedroom of a young
Venetian girl, perhaps a sister of his own.
The comfortable bed, the dainty furniture,
are carefully drawn. The clear morning light
streams into the room. The saint lies peacefully
asleep, her hand under her head, her long
eyelashes resting upon her cheek: the whole is
an idyll, full of insight into girlish life. The
tiny slippers made, no doubt, one of the details
that caught his eye. The crown lying on the
ledge of the bed is an arbitrary introduction,
as na&iuml;f as the angel. In the funeral scene the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>luminous light is diffused over all, the young
saint lies upon her bier and is followed by priest
and deacon, the crowd is composed with truth
to nature, the draperies and garments are brought
into harmony with the sky and background, and
in all those that follow we find this quality of
light. The landscape behind the massacre has
gained in natural character, the city is at some
distance, houses and churches are half buried in
woods; the setting is much more natural than are
the quaint and elegant pages who occupy it, and
who are drawing their crossbows and attacking
the martyrs with leisurely nonchalance. The
panel in which the betrothed couple meet shows
a great advance, and this and the succeeding ones
of the ambassadors, which were painted between
1495 and 1498, must have crowned Carpaccio&#8217;s
reputation. He paints Venice in its most fascinating
aspect; the enamelled beauty of its marbles,
its sky and sea, its palaces and ships, the rich
and picturesque dresses men wore in the streets,
the barge glowing with rich velvets. He evinces
a fairy-tale spirit which we may compare with
the work of Pintoricchio. His Prince, kneeling
in a white and gold dress, with long fair
curls, is a real fairy prince; Ursula, in her red
dress and puffed sleeves, her rippling, flaxen hair
and strings of pearls, is a princess of story.
Carpaccio&#8217;s art is simple and garrulous in feeling,
his conception is as unpassionate as the fancies
of a child, but he has a true love for these gay
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>crowds; Venice going upon her gallant way&mdash;her
solid, worthy citizens, men of substance,
shrewd and valuable, taking their pleasure
seriously with a sense of responsibility. They
throng the streets and cross over the bridges,
every figure is full of freedom and vitality.
The arrival and dismissal of the ambassadors
are the best of all the scenes. In the middle
of the great stage King Maurus of Brittany sits
upon a Venetian terrace. In the colonnade to
the left is gathered a group of Venetian personages,
members of the Loredano family, which
was a special patron of St. Ursula&#8217;s Guild, and
gave this panel. The types are all vividly
realised and differentiated: the courtier looking
critically at the arrivals; the frankly curious
bourgeoisie; the man of fashion passing with
his nose in the air, disdaining to stare too
closely; the fop with his dogs and their dwarf
keeper. Far beyond stretch the lagoons; the
sea and air of Venice clear and fresh. What
is noticeable even now in an Italian crowd, the
absence of women, was then most true to life, for
except on special occasions they were not seen
in the streets, but were kept in almost Oriental
seclusion. The dismissal of the ambassadors
affords the opportunity for drawing an interior
with the street visible through a doorway. A
group at the side, of a man dictating a letter
and the scribe taking down his words, writing
laboriously, with his shoulders hunched and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>head on one side, is excellent in its quiet reality.
The same life-like vivacity is displayed in Ursula&#8217;s
consultation with her father. The old nurse
crouched upon the steps is introduced to break
the line and to throw back the main group.
Carpaccio has already used such a figure in the
funeral scene, and Titian himself adopts his
suggestion.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Carpaccio.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARRIVAL OF THE AMBASSADORS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Venice.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p>Carpaccio is not a very great painter, but a
charming one. His treatment of light and
water, of distant hills and trees, shows a sense
of peace and poetry, and though he is influenced
by Gentile&#8217;s splendid realistic heads, the
type which appeals to him is gentler and more
idealised. His fancy is caught by Oriental
details, to which Gentile would naturally have
directed his attention, and of which there was
no lack in Venice at this time. All his episodes
are very clearly illustrated, and his popular brush
was kept busily employed. He took a share with
other assistants in the series which Gentile was
painting in S. Giovanni Evangelista. In 1502
the Dalmatians inhabiting Venice resolved to
decorate their school, which had been founded
fifty years earlier, for the relief of destitute
Dalmatian seamen in Venice. The subjects
were to be selected from the lives of the Saviour
and the patron saints of Dalmatia and Albania,
St. Jerome, St. George of the Sclavonians, and St.
Tryphonius. The nine panels and an altarpiece
which Carpaccio delivered between 1502 and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>1508 still adorn the small but dignified Hall of
the school. His &ldquo;Jerome in his Study&rdquo; has
nothing ascetic, but shows a prosperous Venetian
ecclesiastic seated in his well-furnished library
among his books and writings. He is less
successful in his scenes from the life of Christ;
the Gethsemane is an obvious imitation of
Mantegna; but when he leaves his own style he
is weak and poor, and imaginary scenes are quite
beyond him. In the death and interment of St.
Jerome he gives a delightful impression of the
peace of the old convent garden, and in the scene
where the lion introduced by the saint scatters
the terrified monks he lets a sense of humour
have free play. The monks in their long
garments, escaping in all directions, are really
comical, and in conjunction with the ingratiating
smile of the lion, the scene passes into the region
of broad farce. We divine the same sense of the
comic in the scene in St. Ursula&#8217;s history, where
the 11,000 virgins are hurrying in single file
along a winding road which disappears out of
the picture. In the principal scene in the life
of St. George, Carpaccio again achieves a masterpiece.
The force and vivacity of the saint in
armour charging the dragon, lingers long in the
memory. The long, decorative lines of lance
and war-horse and dragon throw back the whole
landscape. The details show an almost childish
delight in the realisation of ghoulish horrors.
He rather injures his &ldquo;Triumph of St. George&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>by his anxiety to bring in the Temple of Solomon
at Jerusalem; the flying flags distract the eye,
and the whole scene is one of confusion, broken
up into different parts, while the dragon is
reduced to very unterrifying insignificance. His
series for the school of the Albanians dealt with
the life of the Virgin, who was their special
patron. Its remains are at Bergamo, Milan, and
in the Academy. The single figures in the
&ldquo;Presentation,&rdquo; the priest and maiden, are
excellent. A child at the side of the steps,
leading a unicorn, emblem of chastity, shows
once more what a hold this use of a figure had
taken of him. In the &ldquo;Visitation&rdquo; the figures
are too much scattered, and the fantastic buildings
attract more attention than the women. He
still produced altarpieces, and the Presentation
of the Infant Christ in the Temple, which he
was called upon to paint for San Giobbe, where
one of Bellini&#8217;s most famous altarpieces stood,
challenged him to put forth all his strength. He
never produced anything more simple and noble
or more worthy of the cinque-cento than this
altarpiece (now in the Academy). It surpasses
Bellini&#8217;s arrangement in the way in which the
personages are raised upon a step, while the dome
overhead and the angel musicians below give
them height and dignity. The contrast between
the infant and the youthful woman and the
old men is purposely marked. Such a contrast
between youth and age is a very favourite one.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Bellini, in the same church, draws it between
SS. Sebastian and Job, and Alvise Vivarini, in his
last painting, balances a very youthful Sebastian
with St. Jerome. This is the most grandiose,
the least of a <em>genre</em> picture of all Carpaccio&#8217;s
creations, although he does make Simeon into a
pontiff with attendant cardinals bearing his train.
One of his last works is the S. Vitale over the
high altar of the church of that name, where
we forgive the wooden appearance of the horse
which the saint rides for the sake of the simple
dignity of the rider and the airy effect given by
the balcony overhead. Nor must we forget that
study of the &ldquo;Two Courtesans&rdquo; in the Museo
Civico, full of the sarcasm of a deep realism.
It conveys to us the matter-of-fact monotony of
the long, hot days, and the women and the animals
with which they are beguiling their idle hours
are painted with the greatest intelligence. It
carries us back to another phase of life in
Carpaccio&#8217;s Venice, seen through his observant,
humorous eyes, and if there is nothing in his
colour distinctive of the impending Venetian
richness, it is still arresting in its brilliant
limpidity; it seems drawn straight from the
transparent canals and radiant lagoons.</p>

<p>We apprehend the difference at once in
Bastiani and in Mansueti, who essay the same
sort of compositions. They studied grouping
carefully, and it must have seemed easy enough
to paint their careful architecture and to place
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>citizens in costume with appropriate action in a
&ldquo;Miracle of the Cross,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Preaching of St.
Mark&rdquo;; but these pictures are dry and crowded,
they give no illusion of truth, there is none of
the careless realism of Carpaccio&#8217;s crowds,&mdash;of
incidents taking place which are not essential to
the story, and, as in life, are only half seen, but
which have their share in producing a full and
varied illusion. The scenes want the air and
depth in which Carpaccio&#8217;s pictures are enveloped.
We are not stimulated and charmed, taken into
the outer air and refreshed by these heavy personages,
standing in rows, painted in hot, dry
colour, and carrying no conviction in their
glance and action.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>GIOVANNI BELLINI</strong></p>


<p>The difference between Gian. Bellini and his
accomplished brother, that which makes us so
conscious that the first was the greater of the
two and which sets him in a later artistic generation
than Gentile, is a difference of mind. Such
pageant-pictures as we hear that Giovanni was
engaged upon have all been destroyed. We may
suspect that their composition was not particularly
congenial to him, and that the strictly
religious pictures and the small allegorical
studies, by which we must judge him, were
more after his heart. It is his poetic and ideal
feeling which adds so strongly to his claim to be
a great artist; it was this which drew all men
to him and enabled him so powerfully to influence
the art of his day in Venice.</p>

<p>Jacopo&#8217;s wife, Anna, in a will of 1429, leaves
everything to her two sons, Gentile and Niccolo.
Giovanni was evidently not her son, but Vasari
speaks of him as the elder of the two, so that it
is very possible that he was an illegitimate child,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>brought up, after the fashion that so often
obtained, in the full privileges of his father&#8217;s
house. Documents show that Jacopo Bellini
was living in Venice in 1437, first near the
Piazza, and afterwards in the parish of San Lio.
He was a member of S. Giovanni Evangelista,
and probably one of the leading artists of the
city. His two sons helped him in his great
decorative works, and also went with him to
Padua, where he painted the Gattamalata Chapel.
Their relative position is suggested by a document
of 1457, which records that the father
received twenty-one ducats for &ldquo;three figures,
done on cloth, put in the Great Hall of the
Patriarch,&rdquo; only two of which were to go to
the son. In 1459 Gian. Bellini&#8217;s signature first
appears on a document, and at about this time
we may suppose that he and his brother began to
execute small commissions on their own account.
On these visits to Padua the intimacy must
have sprung up, which led to Mantegna&#8217;s
marriage in 1453 with Jacopo&#8217;s daughter. At
Padua, too, Bellini, in company with Mantegna,
drank in the inspiration left there by Donatello,
the greatest master that either of
them encountered. It was the humanistic and
naturalistic side of Donatello which touched
Giovanni Bellini, more than all his classic lore.
It chimed in, too, with his father&#8217;s graceful and
fanciful quality, and there is no doubt that the
Venetian painters soon exercised a marked influence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>on Mantegna. They &ldquo;fought for him with
Squarcione,&rdquo; and even in the Eremitani frescoes
he begins to lose his purely statuesque type and
to become frankly Renaissance. In the later
scenes of the series a pergola with grapes, a
Venetian campanile and doorway replace his
classic towers and arches of triumph. In the
&ldquo;Martyrdom of St. James&rdquo; the couple walking by
and paying no attention whatever to the tragic
event, are very like the people whom Gentile
introduces in his backgrounds.</p>

<p>There are few documents more interesting
in the history of art than the two pictures of
the &ldquo;Agony in the Garden,&rdquo; executed by the
brothers-in-law, about 1455, from a design by
Jacopo in the British Museum sketch-book.
Jacopo draws the mound-like hill, Christ kneeling
before the vision of the Chalice, the figures
wrapt in slumber, and the distant town. In few
pictures up to this time is the landscape conceived
in such sympathy with the figures. As
we look at this sketch and examine the two
finished compositions, which it is so fortunate
to find in juxtaposition in the National Gallery,
we surmise that the two artists agreed to
carry out the same idea and each to give his
version of Jacopo&#8217;s suggestion, and very curious
it is to see the rendering each has produced.</p>

<p>Mantegna has made use of the most formal
and Squarcionesque contours in his surroundings.
The rocks are of an unnatural, geological structure.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>The towers of Jerusalem are defined in elaborate
perspective, and a band of classic figures fills the
middle distance. The sleeping forms of the
disciples are laid about like so many draped
statues taken from their pedestals. The choir
of child angels is solid and leaves nothing to the
imagination, and if it were not for the beautifully
conceived Christ, the whole composition would
leave us quite unmoved. On the other hand,
we can never look at Bellini&#8217;s version without
a fresh thrill. He, like Mantegna, has followed
Jacopo&#8217;s scheme of winding roads and the city
&ldquo;set on a hill,&rdquo; and has drawn the advancing
band of soldiers; but, independent of all details,
he gives us the vision of a poet. The still dawn
is breaking over the broadly painted landscape,
the rosy shafts of light are colouring the sky
and casting their magic over every common
object, and, lonely and absorbed, the Sacred
Figure kneels, wrapt into the Heavenly Vision,
which is hardly more definite than a stronger
beam of light upon the radiance. One of the
disciples, at least, is a successful and natural
study of a tired-out man, whose head has fallen
back and whose every limb has relaxed in sleep.
Bellini is less assured, less accomplished than
Mantegna, but he is able to touch us with the
pathos of both natural and spiritual feeling.</p>

<p>Even earlier than this picture, critics place
the &ldquo;Crucifixion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Transfiguration&rdquo; of the
Museo Correr and our own &ldquo;Salvator Mundi.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>In 1443, when Giovanni was a young man of
four or five and twenty, San Bernardino had
held a great revival at Padua, and the whole of
Venice had thronged to hear him. It is very
possible, as Mr. Roger Fry suggests in his <em>Life
of Bellini</em>, that Giovanni&#8217;s emotional temperament
had been worked upon by the preacher&#8217;s
eloquence, and the very poignant feelings of
love and pity which his early art expresses were
the deliberate consequence of his sympathy with
the deep religious mysteries expounded.</p>

<p>In the two pictures in the Correr, Bellini is
still going with the Paduan current. In both we
have the winding roads so characteristic of his
father, but the rocks in the &ldquo;Transfiguration&rdquo;
have the jointed, arbitrary character of Mantegna&#8217;s
and the draperies are plastered to the forms
beneath; yet the figures here have a beauty and
a dignity which no reproduction seems able to
convey. The feeling is already more imposing
than the execution. Christ and the two prophets
tower up against the belt of clouds, the central
figure conveying a sense of pathetic isolation;
while below, St. John&#8217;s attitude betrays a state of
tension, the feet being drawn up and contorted.
This picture prepares us for the overwhelming
emotion we find in the &ldquo;Redeemer&rdquo; and the
group of Piet&agrave;s. The treatment of the Christ
was a development of the early <em>motif</em> of angels
flying forward on either side of the Cross, but
here the sacred blood pouring into the chalice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>is also sacramental and connected with the intensified
religious fervour which had led to the
foundation of the Franciscan and Dominican
orders, illustrations of which are met with in
the miniatures and wood-engravings of fifteenth-century
books of devotion. The accessories, the
antique reliefs, the low wall, the distant buildings,
have an allegorical meaning underlying each one,
and common to trecento and, in a less degree, to
quattrocento art. Paradise regained is signified
by the paved court with the open door, in contradistinction
to the Hortus Clausus, or enclosed
court; the type of the old covenant. In one of
the bas-reliefs Mucius Scaevola thrusts his hand
into the fire, the ancient type of heroic readiness
to suffer. The other represents a pagan sacrifice,
foreshadowing the sacrifice upon the Cross.
Figures in the background are leaving a ruined
temple and making their way towards the new
Christian city, fortified and crowned with a
church tower, and in the midst of all this
symbolism, Christ and the attendant angel are
placed, vibrating with nervous feeling.</p>

<p>During the next few years, Bellini devoted
himself to two subjects of the highest devotional
order. These are the Madonna and Child, the
great exercise in every age for painters, and the
Piet&agrave;, which he has made peculiarly his own.</p>

<p><a name="pieta" id="pieta"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/img116.jpg" width="550" height="428" alt="image" title="" />
</div>
<p class="caption"><em>Giovanni Bellini.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PIET&Agrave;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Brera, Milan.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Brogi.</em>)</p>

<p>Close by, at Padua, Giotto had left a rendering
of the last subject, so full of passionate sorrow
that it is hardly possible that it should not, if only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>half consciously, have stimulated the artistic
sensibilities of the most sensitive of painters; but
Bellini&#8217;s pathos shrinks from all exaggeration.
He conceives grief with the tenderest insight.
His interest in the subject was so intense that he
never left the execution to others, and though
not a single one bears his signature, yet each is
entirely by his own hand. Besides the Piet&agrave; at
Milan, which is perhaps the best known, there is
one in the Correr Museum, another in the Doge&#8217;s
Palace, and yet others at Rimini and at Berlin.
The version he adopts, which places the Body of
Christ within the sarcophagus, was a favourite in
North Italy. Donatello uses it in a bas-relief
(now in the Victoria and Albert Museum), but
whether he brought or found the suggestion in
Padua nothing exists to show. Jacopo has left
sketches in which the whole group is within the
tomb, and this rendering is followed by Carpaccio,
Crivelli, Marco Zoppo, and others. It is never
found in trecento art, and is probably traceable
to the Paduan impulse to make use of classic
remains.</p>

<p>Giovanni Bellini&#8217;s Piet&agrave;s fall into two groups.
In one, the Christ is placed between the Virgin
and St. John, who are embodiments of the agony
of bereavement. In the other, the dead Redeemer
is supported by angels, who express the
amazement and grief of immortal beings who see
their Lord suffering an indignity from which they
are immune.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p><p>Mary and St. John <em>inside</em> the sarcophagus
shows that they are conceived mystically; Mary
as the Church, and St. John as the personification
of Christian Philosophy&mdash;a significance frequently
attached to these figures. Such a picture was designed
to hang over the altar, at which the mystical
sacrifice of the Mass was perpetually offered.</p>

<p>In his treatment of the Brera example Bellini
has shaken off the Paduan tradition, and is forming
his own style and giving free play to his own
feeling. The winding roads and evening sky,
barred with clouds, are the accessories he used in
the &ldquo;Agony in the Garden,&rdquo; but the figures are
treated much more boldly; the drapery falls in
broad masses, and scarcely a trace is left of
sculpturesque treatment. Careful as is the study
of the nude, everything is subordinated to the
emotion expressed by the three figures: the
helpless, indifferent calm of the dead, the tender
solicitude of the Mother, the wandering, dazed
look of the despairing friend. Here there is
nothing of beautiful or pathetic symbol; the
group is intense with the common sorrow of all
the world. Mary presses the corpse to her as if
to impart her own life, and gazes with anguished
yearning on the beloved face. Bellini seems to
have passed to a more complex age in his analysis
of suffering, yet here is none of the extravagance
which the primitive masters share with the
Caracci: his restraint is as admirable as his
intensity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p><p>In the Rimini version the tender concern
and questioning surprise of the attendant angels
contrast with the inert weight of the beautiful
dead body they support. Their childish limbs
and butterfly wings make a sinuous pattern
against the lacquered black of the ground-work,
and Mr. Roger Fry makes the interesting suggestion
that the effect, reminiscent of Greek vase-painting,
and the likeness of the Head of Christ
to an old bronze, may, in a composition painted
for Sigismondo Malatesta, be no mere accident,
but a concession to the patron&#8217;s enthusiasm for
classic art.</p>

<p>In 1470 Bellini received his first commission
in the Scuola di San Marco. Gentile had been
employed there since 1466 on the history of the
Israelites in the desert. Bellini agreed to paint
&ldquo;The Deluge and the Ark of Noah&rdquo; with all its
attendant circumstances, but of these, except
from Vasari&#8217;s descriptions, we can form no idea.
These great pageant-pictures had become identified
with the Bellini and their following, while
the production of altarpieces was peculiarly the
province of the Vivarini. Here Bellini effected
a change, for sacred subjects best suited the restrained
and simple perfection of his style, and
afforded the most sympathetic opening for his
idealistic spirit. For the next twenty years or
more, however, he was unavoidably absorbed in
public work, for we hear of his being given the
direction of that which Gentile left unfinished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>in the Ducal Palace when he went to the East in
1479. In 1492, Giovanni being ill, Gentile superintended
the work for him, and in that year he
was appointed to paint in the Hall of the Grand
Council, at an annual salary of sixty ducats.
Other commissions were turned out of the <em>bottega</em>
he had set up with his brother in 1471, and
between that year and 1480 he went to Pesaro
to paint the important altarpiece that still holds
its place there. It is in some ways the greatest
and most powerful thing that Bellini ever accomplished.
The central figures and the attendant
saints have a large gravity and carefully studied
individuality. St. Jerome, absorbed in his theological
books, an ascetic recluse, is admirably
contrasted with the sympathetic, cultured St.
Paul. The landscape, set in a marble frame,
is a gem of beauty, and proves what an appeal
nature was making to the painter. The predella,
illustrating the principal scenes in the lives of
the saints around the altar, is full of Oriental
costumes. The horses are small Eastern horses,
very unlike the ponderous Italian war-horse,
and the whole is evidently inspired by the
sketches which Gentile brought back on his
return from Constantinople in 1481.</p>

<p>Looking from one to another of the cycle of
Madonna pictures which Bellini produced, and
of which so many hang side by side in the
Academy, we are able to note how his conception
varied. In one of the earliest the Child
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>lies across its Mother&#8217;s knee, in the attitude
borrowed from his father and the Vivarini, from
whom, too, he takes the uplifted hands, placed
palm to palm. The earlier pictures are of the
gentle and adoring type, but his later Madonnas
are stately Venetian ladies. He gives us a
queenly woman, with full throat and stately
poise, in the Madonna degli Alberi, in which
the two little trees are symbols of the Old and
New Testament; or, again, he paints a lovely
intellectual face with chiselled and refined
features, and sad dark eyes, and contrasts it
dramatically with the bluff St. George in
armour; and there is another Madonna between
St. Francis and St. Catherine, a picture which
has a curious effect of artificial light.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>GIOVANNI BELLINI</strong> (<em>continued</em>)</p>


<p>In 1497 the Maggior Consiglio of the Venetian
Republic appointed Bellini superintendent of the
Great Hall, and conferred on him the honourable
title of State Painter. In this capacity he was
the overseer of all public works of painting, and
was expected to devote a part of his time to the
decoration of the Hall. Sansovino enumerates
nine of his historical paintings, which had been
painted before the State appointment, all having
reference to the visit of Pope Alexander; but
though he must have been much engrossed, he
seems to have suspended the work from time to
time, for between 1485 and 1488 he painted the
large altarpiece in the Frari, that at San Pietro
in Murano, and the one in the Academy, which
was painted for San Giobbe. Of these three, the
last shows the greatest advance and is fullest of
experiment. The Madonna is a grand ecclesiastical
figure. It has been said with truth
that it is a picture which must have afforded
great support and dignity to the Church. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>Infant has an expression of omniscience, and the
Mother gazes out of the picture, extending
invitation and encouragement to the advancing
worshippers. The religious feeling is less profound;
the artist has been more absorbed
in the contrast between the beautiful, youthful
body of St. Sebastian and that of St. Giobbe,
older but not emaciated, and with the exquisite
surface that his now complete mastery of oil-painting
enabled him to produce. This technique
has evidently been a great delight, and
is here carried to perfection; the skin of St.
Sebastian gleams with a gloss like the coat of
a horse in high condition. Everything that
architecture, sculpture, and rich material can
supply is borrowed to enhance the grandeur of
the group; but the line of sight is still close to
the bottom of the picture, and if it were not for
the exquisite grace with which the angels are
placed, the Madonna would have a broad,
clumsy effect. The Madonna of the Frari is
the most splendid in colour of all his works.
As he paints the rich light of a golden interior
and the fused and splendid colours, he seems to
pass out of his own time and gives a foretaste
of the glory that is to follow. The Murano
altarpiece is quite a different conception; instead
of the seclusion of the sanctuary, it is a smiling,
<em>plein air</em> scene: the Mother benign, the Child
soft and playful, the old Doge Barbarigo and the
patron saints kneeling among bright birds, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>garden and medi&aelig;val townlet filling up the
background, for which, by the way, he uses the
same sketch as in the Pesaro picture. It says
much for his versatility that he could within a
short time produce three such different versions.</p>

<p>Among Bellini&#8217;s most fascinating achievements
in the last years of the fifteenth century are
his allegorical paintings, known to us by the
&ldquo;P&eacute;lerinage de l&#8217;&Acirc;me&rdquo; in the Uffizi and the
little series in the Academy. The meaning of
the first has been unravelled by Dr. Ludwig
from a medi&aelig;val poem by Guillaume de
Guilleville, a Cistercian monk who wrote about
1335, and it is interesting to see the hold it has
taken on Bellini&#8217;s mystic spirit. The paved
space, set within the marble rail, signifies, as in
the &ldquo;Salvator Mundi,&rdquo; the Paradise where souls
await the Resurrection. The new-born souls
cluster round the Tree of Life and shake its
boughs. The poem says:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
There is no pilgrim who is not sometimes sad<br />
Who has not those who wound his heart,<br />
And to whom it is not often necessary<br />
To play and be solaced<br />
And be soothed like a child<br />
With something comforting.<br />
Know that those playing<br />
There in order to allay their sorrow<br />
Have found beneath that tree<br />
An apple that great comfort gives<br />
To those that play with it.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p><p>This may be an allusion to sacramental comfort.
St. Peter and St. Paul guard the door,
beside which the Madonna and a saint sit in holy
conversation. A very beautiful figure on the
left, wrapped in a black shawl, requires explanation,
and it has been suggested that it is the
donor, a woman who may have lost husband and
children, and who, still in life, is introduced,
watching the happiness of the souls in Paradise.
SS. Giobbe and Sebastian, who might have
stepped out of the San Giobbe altarpiece, are
obviously the patron saints of the family, and St.
Catherine, at the Virgin&#8217;s side, may be the donor&#8217;s
own saint. This picture, with its delicious
landscape bathed in atmospheric light, is a
forerunner of those Giorgionesque compositions
of &ldquo;pure and unquestioning delight in the
sensuous charm of rare and beautiful things&rdquo;
in which the artistic nature is even more engrossed
than with the intellectual conception,
and within its small space Bellini seems to have
enshrined all his artistic creed. The allegories
in the Academy are also full of meaning. They
are decorative works, and were probably painted
for some small cabinet. They seem too small
for a cassone. They are ruined by over-painting,
but still full of grace and fancy. The figure in
the classic chariot, bearing fruit, in the encounter
between Luxury and Industry, is drawn from
Jacopo&#8217;s triumphant Bacchus. Fortune floats in
her barque, holding the globe, and the souls
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>who gather round her are some full of triumphant
success, others clinging to her for comfort, while
several are sinking, overwhelmed in the dark
waters. &ldquo;Prudence,&rdquo; the only example of a
female nude in Bellini&#8217;s works, holds a looking-glass.
Hypocrisy or Calumny is torn writhing
from his refuge. The Summa Virtus is an ugly
representation of all the virtues; a waddling
deformity with eyes bound holds the scales of
justice; the pitcher in its hand means prudence,
and the gold upon its feet symbolises charity.
The landscape, both of this and of the &ldquo;Fortune,&rdquo;
resembles that which he was painting in his
larger works at the end of the century. Soon
after 1501 Bellini entered into relations with
Isabela d&#8217;Este, Marchioness of Gonzaga. That
distinguished collector and connoisseur writes
through her agent to get the promise of a
picture, &ldquo;a story or fable of antiquity,&rdquo; to be
placed in position with the allegories which
Mantegna had contributed to her &ldquo;Paradiso.&rdquo;
Bellini agreed to supply this, and received twenty-five
ducats on account. He seems, however, to
have felt that he would be at a disadvantage in
competing with Mantegna on his own ground,
and asks to be allowed to choose his subject.
Isabela was unwillingly obliged to content herself
with a sacred picture, and a &ldquo;Nativity&rdquo; was
selected. She is at once full of suggestions,
desiring to add a St. John Baptist, whom Bellini
demurs at introducing except as a child, but in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>April 1504 the commission is still unaccomplished,
and Isabela angrily demands the return
of her money. This brings a letter of humble
apology from Bellini, and presently the picture
is forwarded. Lorenzo of Pavia writes that it is
quite beautiful, and that &ldquo;though Giovanni has
behaved as badly as possible, yet the bad must
be taken with the good.&rdquo; The joy of its
acquisition appeased Isabela, who at once began
to lay plans to get a further work out of Bellini,
and in 1505 Bembo wrote to her that he would
take a fresh commission always providing he
might fix the subject. From the catalogue of
her Mantovan pictures we gather that the picture
&ldquo;sul asse&rdquo; (on panel) represented the &ldquo;B.V.,
il Putto, S. Giovanni Battista, S. Giovanni
Evangelista, S. Girolamo, and Santa Caterina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great altarpieces which remain strike us
less by their research, their preoccupation with
new problems of paint or grouping, than by
their intense delight in beauty. Bellini was
now nearly eighty years old, and in 1504 the
young Giorgione had proclaimed a revolution
in art with his Castelfranco Madonna. In
composition and detail the Madonna of San
Zaccaria is in some degree a protest against the
Arcadian, innovating fashion of approaching a
religious scene, of which the Church had long
since decided on the treatment, yet Bellini
cannot escape the indirect suggestion of the
new manner. The same leaven was at work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>in him which was transforming the men of a
younger generation. In this altarpiece, in the
Baptism at Vicenza, in others, perhaps, which
have perished, and above all in the hermit saint
in S. Giovanni Crisostomo he is linked in feeling
and in treatment with the later Venetian School.</p>

<p>The new device, which he adopts quite
naturally, of raising the line of sight, sets the
figures in increased depth. For the first time
he gives height and majesty to the young
Mother by carrying the draperies down over the
steps. He realises to the full the contrast
between the young, fragile heads of his girl-saints
and the dark, venerable countenances of
the old men. The head of S. Lucy, detaching
itself like a flower upon its stem, reminds us of
the type which we saw in his Watcher in the
sacred allegory of the Uffizi. The arched,
dome-like niche opens on a distance bathed in
golden light. Bellini keeps the traditions of
the old hieratic art, but he has grasped a new
perfection of feeling and atmosphere. Who the
saints are matters little; it is the collective
enjoyment of a company of congenial people
that pleases us so much. The &ldquo;Baptism&rdquo; in
S. Corona, at Vicenza, painted sixteen years later
than Cima&#8217;s in S. Giovanni in Bragora, is in
frank imitation of the younger man. Christ and
the Baptist, traditional figures, are drawn without
much zest, in a weak, conventional way,
but the artist&#8217;s true interest comes out in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>beauty of face and gesture of the group of
women holding the garments, and above all in
the sombre gloom of the distance, which replaces
Cima&#8217;s charming landscape, and which keys the
whole picture to the significance of a portent.
In the enthronement of the old hermit, S.
Chrysostom himself, painted in 1513, Bellini
keeps his love for the golden dome, but he lets
us look through its arch, at rolling mountain
solitudes, with mists rising between their folds.
The geranium robe of the saint, an exquisite,
vivid bit of colouring, is caught by the golden
sunset rays, the fine ascetic head stands out
against the evening sky, and in the faces of the
two saints who stand on either side of the aged
visionary Bellini has gone back to all his old
intensity of religious feeling, a feeling which
he seemed for a time to have exchanged for a
more pagan tone.</p>

<p>In 1507, at Gentile&#8217;s death, Giovanni undertook,
at his brother&#8217;s dying request, to finish
the &ldquo;Preaching of St. Mark,&rdquo; receiving as a
recompense that coveted sketch-book of his
father&#8217;s, from which he had adopted so many
suggestions, and which, though he was the
eldest, had been inherited by the legitimate son.</p>

<p>In the preceding year Albert D&uuml;rer had
visited Venice for the second time, and Bellini
had received him with great cordiality. D&uuml;rer
writes, &ldquo;Bellini is very old, but is still the best
painter in Venice&rdquo;; and adds, &ldquo;The things I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>admired on my last visit, I now do not value at
all.&rdquo; Implying that he was able now to see
how superior Bellini was to the hitherto more
highly esteemed Vivarini.</p>

<p>At the very end of Bellini&#8217;s life, in 1514,
the Duke of Ferrara paid him eighty-five ducats
for a painting of &ldquo;Bacchanals,&rdquo; now at Alnwick
Castle; which may be looked upon as an
open confession by one who had always considered
himself as a painter of distinctively
religious works, that such a gay scene of feasting
afforded opportunities which he could not resist,
for beauty of attitude and colour; but the gods,
sitting at their banquet in a sunny glade, are
almost fully draped, and there is little of the
<em>abandon</em> which was affected by later painters.
The picture was left unfinished, and was later
given to Titian to complete. In his capacity as
State Painter to the Republic, it was Bellini&#8217;s
duty to execute the official portraits of the
Doges. During his long life he saw eleven
reigns, and during four he held the State
appointment. Besides the official, he painted
private portraits of the Doges, and that of
Doge Loredano, in the National Gallery, is one of
the most perfect presentments of the quattrocento.
This portrait, painted by one old man of another,
shows no weakening in touch or characterisation.
It is as brilliant and vigorous as it is direct and
simple. The face is quiet and unexaggerated;
there is no unnatural fire and feeling, but an air
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>of accustomed dignity and thought, while the
technique has all the perfection of the painter&#8217;s
prime.</p>

<p>In 1516 Giovanni was buried in the Church
of SS. Giovanni and Paolo, by the side of his
brother Gentile. To the last he was popular
and famous, overwhelmed with attentions from
the most distinguished personages of the city.
Though he had begun life when art showed
such a different aspect, he was by nature so
imbued with that temperament, which at the
time of his death was beginning to assert itself
in the younger school, that he was able to
assimilate a really astonishing share of the new
manner. He is guided by feeling more than
by intellect. All the time he is working out
problems, he is dominated by the emotion of
his subject, but his emotion, his pathos, are
invariably tempered and restrained by the calm
moderation of the quattrocento. The golden
mean still has command of Bellini, and never
allows his feelings, however poignant, to degenerate
into sentimentality or violence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>CIMA DA CONEGLIANO AND OTHER FOLLOWERS
OF BELLINI</strong></p>


<p>The rising tide of feeling, the growing sense
of the joy of life and the apprehension of pure
beauty, which was strengthening in the people
and leading up to the great period of Venetian
art, flooded round Bellini and recognised its expression
in him. He was more popular and had a
larger following among the artists of his day than
either Gentile or Carpaccio with their frankly
mundane talent. Whatever Giovanni&#8217;s State works
may have been, his religious paintings are the
ones which are copied and adapted and studied
by the younger band of artists, and this because
of their beauty and notwithstanding their conventional
subjects. Gentile&#8217;s pageant-pictures
have still something cold and colourless, with a
touch of the archaic, while Giovanni&#8217;s religious
altarpieces evince a new freedom of handling, a
modern conception of beautiful women, a use of
that colour which was soon to reign triumphant.
As far as it went indeed, its triumph was already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>assured; as Giovanni advanced towards old age,
it was no longer of any use for the young
masters of the day to paint in any way save
the one he had made popular, and one artist
after another who had begun in the school of
Alvise Vivarini ended as the disciple of Giovanni
Bellini.</p>

<p>It was the habit of Bellini to trust much to
his assistants, and as everything that went out of
his workshop was signed by his name, even if it
only represented the use of one of his designs, or
a few words of advice, and was &ldquo;passed&rdquo; by the
master, it is no wonder that European collections
were flooded with works, among which only
lately the names of Catena, Previtali, Pennacchi,
Marco Belli, Bissolo, Basaiti, Rondinelli, and
others begin to be disentangled.</p>

<p>Only one of his followers stands out as a
strong and original master, not quite of the first
class, but developing his own individuality while
he draws in much of what both Alvise and
Bellini had to give. Cima da Conegliano,
whose real name was Giovanni Battista, always
signs himself <em>Coneglianensis</em>: the title of Cima,
&ldquo;the Rock,&rdquo; by which he is now so widely
known, having first been mentioned in the
seventeenth century by Boschini, and perhaps
given him by that writer himself. He was a
son of the mountains, who, though he came early
to Venice, and lived there most of his life, never
loses something of their wild freshness, and to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>the end delights in bringing them into his
backgrounds. He lived with his mother at
Conegliano, the beautiful town of the Trevisan
marches, until 1484, when he was twenty-five,
and then came down to Vicenza, where he fell
under the tuition of Bartolommeo Montagna, a
Vicentine painter, who had been studying both
with Alvise and Bellini. Cima&#8217;s &ldquo;Madonna
with Saints,&rdquo; painted for the Church of St.
Bartolommeo, Vicenza, in 1489, shows him still
using the old method of tempera, in a careful,
cold, painstaking style, yet already showing his
own taste. The composition has something of
Alvise, yet that something has been learned
through the agency of Montagna, for the figures
have the latter&#8217;s severity and austere character
and the colour is clearer and more crude than
Alvise&#8217;s. It is no light resemblance, and he
must have been long with Montagna. In the
type of the Christ in Montagna&#8217;s Piet&agrave; at
Monte Berico, in the fondness for airy porticoes,
in the architecture and main features of his
&ldquo;Madonna enthroned&rdquo; in the Museo Civico at
Vicenza, we see characteristics which Cima
followed, though he interpreted them in his
own way. He turns the heavy arches and
domes that Alvise loved, into airy pergolas,
decked with vines. He gives increasing importance
to high skies and to atmospheric distances.
When he got to Venice in 1492, he began to
paint in oils, and undertook the panel of S. John
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>Baptist with attendant saints, still in the Church
of S. Madonna dell&#8217; Orto. The work of this is
rather angular and tentative, but true and fresh,
and he comes to his best soon after, in the
&ldquo;Baptism&rdquo; in S. Giovanni in Bragora, which
Bellini, sixteen years later, paid him the compliment
of copying. It was quite unusual to choose
such a subject for the High Altar, and could
only be justified by devotion to the Baptist,
who was Cima&#8217;s own name-saint as well as
that of the Church. Cima is here at his very
highest; the composition is not derived from
any one else, but is all the conception of an
ingenuous soul, full of intuition and insight.
The Christ is particularly fine and simple,
unexaggerated in pose and type; the arm of the
Baptist is too long, but the very fault serves to
give him a refined, tentative look, which makes
a sympathetic appeal. The attendant angels look
on with an air of sweet interest. The distant
mountains, the undulating country, the little
town of Conegliano, identified by the castle on
its great rock, or <em>Cima</em>, are Arcadian in their
sunny beauty. The clouds, as a critic has pointed
out, are full of sun, not of rain. The landscape
has not the sombre mystery of Titian&#8217;s, but is
bright with the joyous delight of a lover of
outdoor life. As Cima masters the new medium
he becomes larger and simpler, and his forms
lose much of their early angularity. A confraternity
of his native town ordered the grand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>altarpiece which is still in the Cathedral there,
and in this he shows his connection with Venice;
the architecture is partly taken from St. Mark&#8217;s,
the lovely Madonna head recalls Bellini, and a
group of Bellinesque angels play instruments at
the foot of the throne. Cima is, however, never
merged in Bellini. He keeps his own clearly
defined, angular type; his peculiar, twisted curls
are not the curls of Bellini&#8217;s saints, his treatment
of surface is refined, enamel-like, perfectly
finished, but it has nothing of the rich, broken
treatment which Bellini&#8217;s natural feeling for
colour was beginning to dictate. Cima&#8217;s pale
golden figures have an almost metallic sharpness
and precision, and though they are full of
charm and refinement, they may be thought
lacking in spontaneity and passion. To 1501
belongs the &ldquo;Incredulity of St. Thomas,&rdquo; now
in the Academy, but painted for the Guild of
Masons. It is a picture full of expression and
dignity, broad in treatment if a little cold in its
self-restraint. Cima seems to have not quite
enough intellect, and not quite enough strong
feeling. However, the little altarpiece of the
Nativity, in the Church of the Carmine in
Venice, has a richer, fuller touch, and this
foreshadows the work he did when he went to
Parma, where his transparent shadows grow
broader and stronger, and his figures gain in
ease and freedom. He never loses the delicate
radiance of his lights, and his types and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>his architecture alike convey something of a
peculiarly refined, brilliant elegance.</p>

<p>Like all these men of great energy and
prolific genius, Cima produced an astonishing
number of panels and altarpieces, and no doubt
had pupils on his own account, for a goodly list
could be made of pictures in his style, but not
by his own hand, which have been carried by
collectors into widely-scattered places. His
exquisite surface and finish and his marked
originality make him a difficult master to imitate
with any success. His latest work is dated
1508, but Ridolfi says he lived till 1517, and it
seems probable that he returned to his beloved
Conegliano and there passed his last years.</p>

<p>If Cima possessed originality, Vincenzo of
Treviso, called Catena, gained an immense reputation
by his industry and his power of imitating
and adopting the manner of Bellini&#8217;s School. In
those days men did not trouble themselves much
as to whether they were original or not. They
worked away on traditional compositions, frankly
introducing figures from their master&#8217;s cartoons,
modifying a type here, making some little experiment
or arrangement there, and, as a French critic
puts it, leaving their own personality to &ldquo;hatch
out&rdquo; in due time, if it existed, and when it was
sufficiently ripened by real mastery of their art. It
is here that Catena fails; beginning as a journeyman
in the Sala del Gran Consiglio, at a salary
of three ducats a month, he for long failed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>acquire the absolute mastery of drawing which
was possessed by the better disciples of the
schools. But he is painstaking, determined to
get on, and eager to satisfy the continually
increasing demand for work. His draperies are
confused and unmeaning, his faces round, with
small features, inexpressive button mouths, and
weak chins, and his flesh tints have little of
the glow which is later the prerogative of every
second-rate painter. Yet Catena succeeds, like
many another careful mediocre man, in securing
patronage, and as the sixteenth century opened
he gained the distinction from Doge Loredano
of a commission to paint the altarpiece for the
Pregadi Chapel of the Sala di Tre, in the Ducal
Palace. He adapts his group from that of
Bellini in the Cathedral of Murano, bringing
in a profile portrait of the kneeling Doge, of
which he afterwards made numerous copies, one
of which was for long assigned to Gentile and
one to Giovanni Bellini.</p>

<p>That Catena is not without charm, we discern
in such a composition as his &ldquo;Martyrdom of St.
Cristina,&rdquo; in S. Maria Mater Domini, in which
the saint, a solid, Bellinesque figure, kneels
upon the water, in which she met her death,
and is surrounded by little angels, holding up
the millstone tied round her neck, and laden
with other instruments of her martyrdom.
Catena borrows right and left, and tries to
follow every new indication of contemporary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>taste. For instance, he remarks the growing
admiration for colour, and hopes by painting
gay, flat tints, in bright contrast, to produce the
desired effect.</p>

<p>It is evident that he made many friends
among the rich connoisseurs of the time, and
that his importance was out of proportion to
his real merit. Marcantonio Michele, writing
an account of Raphael&#8217;s last days to a friend in
Venice, and touching on Michelangelo&#8217;s illness,
begs him to see that Catena takes care of
himself, &ldquo;as the times are unfavourable to great
painters.&rdquo; Catena had acquired and inherited
considerable wealth; he came of a family of
merchants, and resided in his own house in San
Bartolommeo del Rialto. He lived in unmarried
relations with Dona Maria Fustana, the daughter
of a furrier, to whom he bequeaths in his will
300 ducats and all his personal effects. As a
careful portrait-painter, with a talent for catching
a likeness, he was in constant demand, and in
some of his heads&mdash;that of a canon dressed in
blue and red, at Vienna, and especially in one of
a member of the Fugger family, now at Dresden&mdash;he
attains real distinction. And in his last
phase he does at length prove the power that
lies behind long industry and perseverance.
Suddenly the Giorgionesque influence strikes
him, and turning to imbibe this new element,
he produces that masterpiece which throws a
glamour over all his mediocre performances;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>his &ldquo;Warrior adoring the Infant Christ,&rdquo; in
the National Gallery, is a picture full of charm,
rich and romantic in tone and spirit. The
Virgin and the Child upon her knee are of his
dull round-eyed type, the form and colours of
her draperies are still unsatisfactory, but the
knight in armour with his Eastern turban, the
romantic young page, holding his horse, are
pure Giorgionesque figures. Beautiful in themselves,
set in a beautiful landscape glowing
with light and air, the whole picture exemplifies
what surprising excellence could be
suddenly attained by even very inferior artists,
who were constantly associating with greater
men, at a moment when the whole air was, as
it were, vibrating with genius.</p>

<p>Catena was very much addicted to making
his will, and at least five testaments or codicils
exist, one of them devising a sum of money
for the benefit of the School of Painters in
Venice, and another leaving to his executor, Prior
Ignatius, the picture of a &ldquo;St. Jerome in his
Cell,&rdquo; which may be the one in our national
collection, which remained in Venice till
1862. It is painted in his gay tones, imitating
Basaiti and Lotto, and brings in the partridge of
which he made a sort of sign manual.</p>

<p>Cardinal Bembo writes in 1525 to Pietro
Lippomano, to announce that, at his request, he
is continuing his patronage of Catena:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Though I had done all that lay in my power for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>Vincenzo Catena before I received your Lordship&#8217;s
warm recommendation in his favour, I did not hesitate,
on receipt of your letter, to add something to the first
piece I had from him, and I did so because of my love
and reverence for you, and I trust that he will return
appropriate thanks to you for having remembered that
you could command me.</p></div>

<p>Marco Basaiti was alternately a journeyman
in different workshops and a master on his own
account. For long the assistant and follower of
Alvise Vivarini, we may judge that he was also
his most trusted confidant, for to him was left
the task of completing the splendid altarpiece to
S. Ambrogio, in the Frari. His heavy hand is
apparent in the execution, and the two saints,
Sebastian and Jerome, in the foreground, have
probably been added by him, for they have the
air of interlopers, and do not come up to the rest
of the company in form and conception. The
Sebastian, with his hands behind his back and
his loin cloth smartly tied, is quite sufficiently
reminiscent of Bellini&#8217;s figure of 1473 to make
us believe that Basaiti was at once transferring
his allegiance to that reigning master. In his
earlier phase he has the round heads and the
dry precise manner of the Muranese. In his
large picture in the Academy, the &ldquo;Calling of
the Sons of Zebedee,&rdquo; he produces a large,
important set piece, cold and lifeless, without
one figure which arrests us, or lingers in
the memory. &ldquo;The Christ on the Mount&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>is more interesting as having been painted for
San Giobbe, where Bellini&#8217;s great altarpiece
was already hanging, and coming into competition
with Bellini&#8217;s early rendering of the same
scene. Painted some thirty years later, it is
interesting to see what it has gained in
&ldquo;modernness.&rdquo; The landscape and trees are
well drawn and in good colour, and the saints,
standing on either side of a high portico, have
dignity. In the &ldquo;Dead Christ,&rdquo; in the Academy,
he is following Bellini very closely in the flesh-tints
and the <em>putti</em>. The <em>putti</em>, looking thoughtfully
at the dead, is a <em>motif</em> beloved of Bellini,
but Basaiti cannot give them Bellini&#8217;s pathos
and significance; they are merely childish and
seem to be amused.</p>

<p>In 1515 Basaiti has entered upon a new
phase. He has felt Giorgione&#8217;s influence, and
is beginning to try what he can do, while still
keeping close to Bellini, to develop a fuller touch,
more animated figures, and a brilliant effect of
landscape. He runs a film of vaporous colour
over his hard outlines and makes his figures
bright and misty, and though underneath they
are still empty and monotonous, it is not surprising
that many of his works for a time passed
as those of Bellini. Though he is a clever
imitator, &ldquo;his figures are designed with less
mastery, his drawing is a little less correct,
his drapery less adapted to the under form.
Light and shade are not so cleverly balanced,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>colours have the brightness, but not the true
contrast required. In landscape he proceeds
from a bleak aridity to extreme gaiety; he does
not dwell on detail, but his masses have neither
the sober tint nor the mysterious richness
conspicuous in his teacher ... he is a clever
instrument.&rdquo; Both Previtali and Rondinelli
were workers with Basaiti in Bellini&#8217;s studio.
Previtali occasionally signed himself Andrea
Cordeliaghi or Cordella, and has left many
unsigned pictures. He copies Catena and
Lotto, Palma and Montagna; but for a time his
work went forth from Bellini&#8217;s workshop signed
with Bellini&#8217;s name. In 1515, in a great altarpiece
in San Spirito at Bergamo, he first takes
the title of Previtali, compiling it in the
cartello with the monogram already used as
Cordeliaghi. There are traces of many other
minor artists at this period, all essaying the
same manner, copying one or other of the
masters, taking hints from each other. The
Venetian love of splendour was turning to the
collection of works of art, and the work of
second-class artists was evidently much in
demand and obtained its meed of admiration.
Bissolo was a fellow-labourer with Catena in the
Hall of the Ducal Palace in 1492; he is soft
and nerveless, but he copies Bellini, and has
imbibed something of his tenderness of spirit.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this list how difficult it
is to unravel the tale of the false Bellinis. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>master&#8217;s own works speak for themselves with
no uncertain voice, but away from these it is
very difficult to pronounce as to whether he had
given a design, or a few touches, or advice, and
still more difficult to decide whether these were
bestowed on Basaiti in his later manner, or on
Previtali or Bissolo, or if the teaching was handed
on by them in a still more diluted form to
the lesser men who clustered round, much of
whose work has survived and has been masquerading
for centuries under more distinguished
names. It is sometimes affirmed that the loss
of originality in the endeavour to paint like
greater men has been a symptom of decay in
every school in the past. It is interesting to
notice, therefore, that in every great age of
painting there has always been an undercurrent
of imitation, which has helped to form a stream
of tradition, and which, as far as we can see, has
done no harm to the stronger spirits of the time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>GIORGIONE</strong></p>


<p>When we enter a gallery of Florentine paintings,
we find our admiration and criticism expressing
themselves naturally in certain terms; we are
struck by grace of line, by strenuous study of
form, by the evidence of knowledge, by the
display of thought and intellectual feeling. The
Florentine gestures and attitudes are expressive,
nervous, fervent, or, as in Michelangelo and
Signorelli, alive with superhuman energy. But
when looking at pictures of the Venetian School
we unconsciously use quite another sort of
language; epithets like &ldquo;dark&rdquo; and &ldquo;rich&rdquo;
come most freely to our lips; a golden glow,
a slumberous velvety depth, seem to engulf
and absorb all details. We are carried into the
land of romance, and are fascinated and soothed,
rather than stimulated and aroused. So it is with
portraits; before the &ldquo;Mona Lisa&rdquo; our intelligence
is all awake, but the men and women of
Venetian canvases have a grave, indolent serenity,
which accords well with the slumber of thought.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p><p>Up to the beginning of the sixteenth century
the painters of Venice had not differed very
materially from those of other schools; they
had gradually worked out or learned the technicalities
of drawing, perspective and anatomy.
They had been painting in oils for twenty-five
years, and they betrayed a greater fondness for
pageant-pictures than was felt in other States of
Italy. Florence appoints Michelangelo and Leonardo
to decorate her public palace, but no great
store is set by their splendid achievements; their
work is not even completed. The students fall
upon the cartoons, which are allowed to perish,
instead of being treasured by the nation. Gentile
Bellini and Carpaccio and the band of State
painters are appreciated and well rewarded.
These men have reproduced something of the
lucent transparency, the natural colour of Venice,
but it is as if unconsciously; they are not fully
aiming at any special effect. Year after year
the Venetian masters assimilate more or less
languidly the influences which reach them
from the mainland. They welcome Guariento
and Gentile da Fabriano, they set themselves to
learn from Veronese or Florentine, the Paduans
contribute their chiselled drawing, their learned
perspective, their archeological curiosity. Yet
even early in the day the Venetians escape from
that hard and learned art which is so alien
to their easy, voluptuous temperament. Jacopo
Bellini cannot conform to it, and his greatest son
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>is ready to follow feeling and emotion, and in
his old age is quick to discover the first flavour
of the new wine. If Venetian art had gone
on upon the lines we have been tracing up
to now, there would have been nothing very
distinctive about it, for, however interesting and
charming Alvise and Carpaccio, Cima and the
Bellini may be, it is not of them we think when
we speak of the Venetian School and when we
rank it beside that of Florence, while Giovanni
Bellini alone, in his later works, is not strong
enough to bear the burden.</p>

<p>The change which now comes over painting
is not so much a technical one as a change of
temper, a new tendency in human thought, and
we link it with Giorgione because he was the
channel through which the deep impulse first
burst into the light. We have tried to trace the
growth of the early Venetian School, but it does
not develop logically like that of Florence; it
is not the result of long endeavour, adding one
acquisition and discovery to another. Venetian
art was peculiarly the outcome of personalities,
and it did not know its own mind till the
sixteenth century. Then, like a hidden spring,
it bubbles irresistibly to the surface, and the spot
where it does so is called by the name of a man.</p>

<p>There are beings in most great creative
epochs who, with peculiar facility, seem to
embody the purpose of their age and to yield
themselves as ready instruments to its design.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>When time is ripe they appear, and are able,
with perfect ease, to carry out and give voice
to the desires and tendencies which have been
straining for expression. These desires may owe
their origin to national life and temperament;
it may have taken generations to bring them to
fruition, but they become audible through the
agency of an individual genius. A genius is
inevitably moulded by his age. Rome, in the
seventeenth century, drew to her in Bernini a
man who could with real power illustrate her
determination to be grandiose and ostentatious,
and, at the height of the Renaissance, Venice
draws into her service a man whose sensuous
feeling was instilled, accentuated, and welcomed
by every element around him.</p>

<p>More conclusively than ever, at this time,
Venice, the world&#8217;s great sea-power, was in her
full glory as the centre of the world&#8217;s commerce
and its art and culture. Vasco da Gama had
discovered the sea route to India in 1498, but
the stupendous effect which this was to exert
on the whole current of power did not become
apparent all at once. Venice was still the
great emporium of the East, linked to it by a
thousand ties, Oriental in her love of Eastern
richness.</p>

<p>It would be exaggerating to say that the
Venetians of the sixteenth century could not
draw. As there were Tuscans who understood
beautiful harmonies of colour, so there were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Venetians who knew a good deal about form;
but the other Italians looked upon colour as a
charming adjunct, almost, one might say, as
an amiable weakness: they never would have
allowed that it might legitimately become the
end and aim in painting, and in the same way
form, though respected and considered, was
never the principal object of the Venetians.
Up to this time Venice had fed her emotional
instincts by pageants and gold and velvets and
brocades, but with Giorgione she discovered
that there was a deeper emotional vehicle than
these superficial glories,&mdash;glowing depths of
colour enveloped in the mysterious richness of
chiaroscuro which obliterated form, and hid
and suggested more than it revealed.</p>

<p>Giorgione no longer described &ldquo;in drawing&#8217;s
learned tongue&rdquo;; he carried all before him
by giving his direct impression in colour. He
conceives in colour. The Florentines cared little
if their finely drawn draperies were blue or
red, but Giorgione images purple clouds, their
dark velvet glowing towards a rose and orange
horizon. He hardly knows what attitudes his
characters take, but their chestnut hair, their
deep-hued draperies, their amber flesh, make a
moving harmony in which the importance of
exact modelling is lost sight of. His scenes are
not composed methodically and according to
the old rules, but are the direct impress of the
painter&#8217;s joy in life. It was a new and audacious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>style in painting, and its keynote, and absolutely
inevitable consequence, was to substitute for
form and for gay, simple tints laid upon it, the
quality of chiaroscuro. We all know how
the shades of evening are able to transform
the most commonplace scene; the dull road
becomes a mysterious avenue, the colourless
foliage develops luscious depths, the drab and
arid plain glows with mellow light, purple
shadows clothe and soften every harsh and ugly
object, all detail dies, and our apprehension of
it dies also. Our mood changes; instead of
observing and criticising, we become soothed,
contemplative, dreamy. It is the carrying of
this profound feeling into a colour-scheme by
means of chiaroscuro, so that it is no longer
learned and explanatory, but deeply sensuous
and emotional, that is the gift to art which
found full voice with Giorgione, and which
in one moment was recognised and welcomed
to the exclusion of the older manner, because
it touched the chord which vibrated through
the whole Venetian temperament.</p>

<p>And the immediate result was the picture of
<em>no subject</em>. Giorgione creates for us idle figures
with radiant flesh, or robed in rich costumes,
surrounded by lovely country, and we do not ask
or care why they are gathered together. We
have all had dreams of Elysian fields, &ldquo;where
falls not any rain, nor ever wind blows
loudly,&rdquo; where all is rest and freedom, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>music blends with the plash of fountains, and
fruits ripen, and lovers dream away the days, and
no one asks what went before or what follows
after. The Golden Age, the haunt of fauns and
nymphs: there never has been such a day, or
such a land: it is a mood, a vision: it has
danced before the eyes of poets, from David to
Keats and Tennyson: it has rocked the tired
hearts of men in all ages: the vision of a resting-place
which makes no demands and where the
dwellers are exempt from the cares and weakness
of mortality. Needless to say, it is an ideal born
of the East; it is the Eastern dream of Paradise,
and it speaks to that strain in the temperament
which recognises that life cannot be all thought,
but also needs feeling and emotion. And for the
first time in all the world the painter of Castelfranco
sets that vague dream before men&#8217;s eyes.
The world, with its wistful yearnings and questionings,
such as Leonardo or Botticelli embodied,
said little to his audience. Here was their natural
atmosphere, though they had never known it
before. These deep, solemn tones, these fused
and golden lights are what Giorgione grasps
from the material world, and as he steeps his
senses in them the subject counts but little in
the deep enjoyment they communicate. We,
who have seen his manner repeated and developed
through thousands of pictures, find it difficult to
realise that there had been nothing like it before,
that it was a unique departure, that when Bellini
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>and Titian looked at his first creations they must
have experienced a shock of revelation. The
old definite style must have seemed suddenly
hard and meagre, and every time they looked on
the glorious world, the deep glow of sunset, the
mysterious shades of falling night, they must
have felt they were endowed with a sense to
which they had hitherto been strangers, but
which, it was at once apparent, was their true
heritage. They had found themselves, and in
them Venice found her real expression, and
with Giorgione and those who felt his impetus
began the true Venetian School, set apart from
all other forms of art by its way of using and
diffusing and intensifying colour.</p>

<p>When Giorgione, the son of a member of
the house of Barbarelli and a peasant girl of
Vedelago, came down to Venice, we gather
that he had nothing of the provincial. Vasari,
who must often have heard of him from Titian,
describes him as handsome, engaging, of distinguished
appearance, beloved by his friends, a
favourite with women, fond of dress and amusement,
an admirable musician, and a welcome guest
in the houses of the great. He was evidently
no peasant-bred lad, but probably, though
there is no record of the fact, was brought up,
like many illegitimate children, in the paternal
mansion. His home was not far from the
lagoons, in one of the most beautiful places it is
possible to imagine, on a lovely and fertile plain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>running up to the Asolean hills and with the
Julian Alps lying behind. We guess that he
received his education in the school of Bellini,
for when that master sold his allegory of the
&ldquo;Souls in Paradise&rdquo; to one of the Medici, to
adorn the summer villa of Poggio Imperiale,
there went with it the two small canvases now
in the Uffizi, the &ldquo;Ordeal of Moses&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Judgment of Solomon,&rdquo; delightful little
paintings in Giorgione&#8217;s rich and distinctive style,
but less accomplished than Bellini&#8217;s picture, and
with imperfections in the drawing of drapery
and figures which suggest that they are the
work of a very young man. The love of the
Venetians for decorating the exterior of their
palaces with fresco led to Giorgione being largely
employed on work which was unhappily a
grievous waste of time and talent, as far as
posterity is concerned. We have a record of
fa&ccedil;ades covered with spirited compositions and
heraldic devices, of friezes with Bacchus and
Mars, Venus and Mercury. Zanetti, in his
seventeenth-century prints, has preserved a noble
figure of &ldquo;Fortitude&rdquo; grasping an axe, but beyond
a few fragments nothing has survived. Before
he was thirty Giorgione was entrusted with the
important commission of decorating the Fondaco
dei Tedeschi. This building, which we hear of
so often in connection with the artists of Venice,
was the trading-house for German, Hungarian,
and Polish merchants. The Venetian Government
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>surrounded these merchants with the most
jealous restrictions. Every assistant and servant
connected with them was by law a Venetian, and,
in fact, a spy of the Republic. All transactions
of buying and selling were carried out by Venetian
brokers, of whom some thirty were appointed.
As time went on, some of these brokerships must
have resolved themselves into sinecure offices,
for we find Bellini holding one, and certainly
without discharging any of the original duties,
and they seem to have become some sort of State
retainerships. In 1505 the old Fondaco had been
burnt to the ground, and the present building
was rising when Giorgione and Titian were boys.
A decree went forth that no marble, carving, or
gilding were to be used, so that painting the outside
was the only alternative. The roof was on in
1507, and from that date Giorgione, Titian, and
Morto da Feltre were employed in the adornment
of the fa&ccedil;ade. Vasari is very much exercised
over Giorgione&#8217;s share in these decorations. &ldquo;One
does not find one subject carefully arranged,&rdquo;
he complains, &ldquo;or which follows correctly the
history or actions of ancients or moderns. As for
me, I have never been able to understand the
meaning of these compositions, or have met
any one able to explain them to me. Here one
sees a man with a lion&#8217;s head, beside a woman.
Close by one comes upon an angel or a Love:
it is all an inexplicable medley.&rdquo; Yet he is
delighted with the brilliancy of the colour and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>the splendid execution, and adds, &ldquo;Colour gives
more pleasure in Venice than anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among other early work was the little
&ldquo;Adoration of the Magi,&rdquo; in the National
Gallery, and the so-called &ldquo;Philosophers&rdquo; at
Vienna. According to the latest reading, this
last illustrates Virgil&#8217;s legend that when the
Trojan &AElig;neas arrived in Italy, Evander pointed
out the future site of Rome to the ancient seer
and his son. Giorgione, in painting the scene,
is absorbed in the beauty of nature. It is his
first great landscape, and all accessories have been
sacrificed to intensity of effect. He revels in
the glory of the setting sun, the broad tranquil
masses of foliage, the long evening shadows,
and the effect of dark forms silhouetted against
the radiant light.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>GIORGIONE</strong> (<em>continued</em>)</p>


<p>When Giorgione was twenty-six he went back
to Castelfranco, and painted an altarpiece for the
Church of San Liberale. In the sixteenth
century Tuzio Costanza, a well-known captain
of Free Companions, who had made his fortune
in the wars, where he had been attached to
Catherine Cornaro, followed the dethroned queen
from Cyprus, and when she retired to Asolo,
settled near her at Castelfranco. His son,
Matteo, entered the service of the Venetian
Republic, and became a leader of fifty lances; but
Matteo was killed at the battle of Ravenna in
1504, and Costanza had his son&#8217;s body embalmed
and buried in the family chapel.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of the details of this
commission, but we are not straining the bounds
of probability by assuming that in a little town
like Castelfranco, hardly more than a village,
the two youths must have been well known to
each other, and that this acquaintance and the
familiarity of the one with the appearance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>the other may have been the determining cause
which led the bereaved father to give the commission
to the young painter, while the tragic
circumstances were such as would appeal to an
ardent, enthusiastic nature. A treasure of our
National Gallery is a study made by Giorgione
for the figure of San Liberale, who is represented
as a young man with bare head and crisp, golden
locks, dressed in silver armour, copied from the
suit in which Matteo Costanza is dressed in
the stone effigy which is still preserved in the
cemetery at Castelfranco. At the side of the
stone figure lies a helmet, resembling that on the
head of the saint in the altarpiece.</p>

<p>In Giorgione&#8217;s group the Mother and Child
are enthroned on high, with St. Francis and St.
Liberale on either hand. The Child&#8217;s glance is
turned upon the soldier-saint, a gallant figure
with his lance at rest, his dagger on his hip,
his gloves in his hand, young, high-bred, with
features of almost feminine beauty. The picture
is conceived in a new spirit of simplicity of
design, and shows a new feeling for restraint in
matters of detail. It is the work of a man who
has observed that early morning, like late evening,
has a marvellous power of eliminating all
unessential accessories and of enveloping every
object in a delicious scheme of light. Repainted,
cleaned, restored as the canvas is, it is still full of
an atmosphere of calm serenity. It is not the
ecstatic, devotional reverie of Perugino&#8217;s saints.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>The painter of Castelfranco has not steeped his
whole soul in religious imagination, like the
painter of Umbria; he is an exemplar of the
lyric feeling; his work is a poem in praise of
youth and beauty, and dreams in air and sunshine.
He uses atmosphere to enhance the mood, but
Giorgione carries his unison of landscape with
human feeling much further than Perugino; he
observes the delicate effects of light, and limpid
air circulates in his distance. The sun rising
over the sea throws a glamour and purity of
early morning over a scene meant to glorify
the memory of a young life. The painter
shows his connection with his master by using
the figure of the St. Francis in Bellini&#8217;s San
Giobbe altarpiece. What Bellini owed to
Giorgione is still a matter for speculation. The
San Zaccaria altarpiece was, as we have seen,
painted in the year following that of Castelfranco.
Something has incited the old painter to fresh
efforts; out of his own evolution, or stimulated
by his pupil&#8217;s splendid experiments, he is drawn
into the golden atmosphere of the Venetian
cinque-cento.</p>

<p>The Venetian painters were distinguished
by their love for the kindred art of music.
Giorgione himself was an admirable musician,
and linked with all that is akin to music in his
work, is his love for painting groups of people
knit together by this bond. He uses it as a
pastime to bring them into company, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>rich chords of colour seem permeated with the
chords of sound. Not always, however, does he
need even this excuse; his &ldquo;conversation-pieces&rdquo;
are often merely composed of persons placed with
indescribable grace in exquisite surroundings,
governed by a mood which communicates itself
to the beholder.</p>

<p>With the Florentines, the cartoon was carefully
drawn upon the wall and flat tints were
superimposed. They knew beforehand what the
effect was to be; but the Venetians from this
time gradually worked up the picture, imbedding
tints, intensifying effects, one touch suggesting
another, till the whole rich harmony was gradually
evoked. With the Florentines, too, the figures
supply the main interest; the background is an
arbitrary addition, placed behind them at the
painter&#8217;s leisure, but Giorgione&#8217;s and Titian&#8217;s <em>f&ecirc;tes
champ&ecirc;tres</em> and concerts could not <em>be</em> at all in any
other environment. The amber flesh-tints and
the glowing garments are so blended with the
deep tones of the landscape, that one would not
instil the mood the artist desires without the
other. Piero di Cosimo and Pintoricchio can
place delightful nymphs and fairy princesses in
idyllic scenes, and they stir no emotion in us
beyond an observant pleasure, a detached amusement;
but Giorgione&#8217;s gloomy blues, his figures
shining through the warm dusk of a summer
evening, waken we hardly know what of vague
yearning and brooding memory.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p><p>In the &ldquo;F&ecirc;te Champ&ecirc;tre&rdquo; of the Louvre he
acquires a frankly sensuous charm. He becomes
riper, richer in feeling, and displays great exuberance
of style. The woman filling her pitcher
at the fountain is exquisite in line and curve and
amber colour. She seems to listen lazily to the
liquid fall of the water mingling with the half-heard
music of the pipes. The beautiful idyll
in the Giovanelli Palace is full of art of composition.
It is built up with uprights; pillars are
formed by the groups of trees and figures, cut
boldly across by the horizontal line of the bridge,
but the figures themselves are put in without
any attention to subject, though an unconscious
humorist has discovered in them the domestic
circle of the painter. The man in Venetian dress
is there to assist the left-hand columnar group,
placed at the edge of the picture after the
manner of Leonardo. The woman and child
lighten the mass of foliage on the right and
make a beautiful pattern. The white town of
Castelfranco sings against the threatening sky,
the winds bluster through the space, the trees
shiver with the coming storm. Here and there
leafy boughs are struck in with a slight, crisp
touch, in which we can follow readily the
painter&#8217;s quick impression.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Knight of Malta&rdquo; is a grand magisterial
figure, majestic, yet full of ardent warmth
lying behind the grave, indifferent nobility. The
face is bisected with shadow, in the way which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>Michelangelo and Andrea del Sarto affected, and
the cone-shaped head with parted hair is of
the type which seems particularly to have
pleased the painter. To Giorgione, too, belongs
the honour of having created a Venus as pure as
the Aphrodite of Cnidos and as beautiful as a
courtesan of Titian.</p>

(<em>Photo, Alinari.</em>)</p>

<p>The death of Giorgione from plague in 1511
is registered by all the oldest authorities. His
body was conveyed to Castelfranco by members
of the Barbarelli family and buried in the Church
of San Liberale. In 1638 an epitaph was placed
over his tomb by Matteo and Ercole Barbarelli.</p>

<p>Allowing that he was hardly more than
twenty when his new manner began to gain a
following, he had only some twelve years in
which to establish his deep and lasting influence.
We divine that he was a man of strong personality,
such a one as warms and stimulates his
companions. Even his nickname tells us something,&mdash;Great
George, the Chief, the George of
Georges,&mdash;it seems to express him as a leader.
And we have no lack of proof that he was
admired and looked up to. His style became
the only one that found favour in Venice, and
the painters of the day did their best to conform
to it. Few authentic examples are left from his
own hand, but out of his conscious and devoted
and more or less successful imitators, there grew
up a school, &ldquo;out of all those fascinating works,
rightly or wrongly attributed to him; out of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>many copies from, or variations on him, by
unknown or uncertain workmen, whose drawings
and designs were, for various reasons, prized as
his; out of the immediate impression he made
upon his contemporaries and with which he
continued in men&#8217;s minds; out of many traditions
of subject and treatment which really
descend from him to our own time, and by
retracing which we fill out the original image.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Summing up all these influences, he has left
us the Giorgionesque; the art of choosing a
moment in which the subject and the elements
of colour and design are so perfectly fused and
blended that we have no need to ask for any
more articulate story; a moment into which
all the significance, the fulness of existence has
condensed itself, so that we are conscious of the
very essence of life. Those idylls of beings
wrapped into an ideal dreamland by music
and the sound of water and the beauty of
wood and mountain and velvet sward, need all
our conscious apprehension of life if we are
to drink in their full fascination. The dream
of the Lotos-eaters can only come with force to
those who can contrast it adequately with the
experience, the complication, and the thousand
distractions of an over-civilised world. Rest and
relaxation, the power of the deeply tinted eventide,
or of the fresh morning light, and the calm
that drinks in the sensations they are able to
afford, are among the precious things of life.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>The instinct upon which Giorgione&#8217;s work rests
is the satisfying of the feeling as well as the
thinking faculty, the life of the heart, as compared
to the life of the intellect, the solution of
life&#8217;s problems by love instead of by thought.
It was the Eastern ideal, and its positive expression
is conveyed by means of colour, deep,
restful, satisfying, fused and controlled by
chiaroscuro rather than by form.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE GIORGIONESQUE</strong></p>


<p>Giorgione had given the impulse, and all the
painters round him felt his power. The Venetian
painters that is, for it is remarkable, at a
time when the men of one city observed and
studied and took hints from those of every other,
how faint are the signs that this particular
manner attracted any great attention in other
art centres. Leonardo da Vinci was a master of
chiaroscuro, but he used it only to express his
forms, and never sacrifices to it the delicacy
and fineness of his design. It is the one quality
Raphael never assimilates, except for a brief
instant at the period when Sebastian del Piombo
had arrived in Rome from Venice. It takes hold
most strongly upon Andrea del Sarto, who seems,
significantly enough, to have had no very pronounced
intellectual capacity, but in Venice itself
it now became the only way. The old Bellini
finds in it his last and fullest ideal; Catena,
Basaiti, Cariani do their best to acquire it, and so
successfully was it acquired, so congenial was it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>to Venetian art, that even second-&nbsp;and third-rate
Venetian painters have usually something attractive
which triumphs over superficial and doubtful
drawing and grouping. It is easy to see how
much to their taste was this fused and golden
manner, this disregard of defined form, and this
new play of chiaroscuro. The Venetian room
in the National Gallery is full of such examples:
the Nymphs and <em>Amoretti</em> of No. 1695, charming
figures against melting vines and olives; &ldquo;Venus
and Adonis,&rdquo; in which a bewitching Cupid
chases a butterfly; Lovers in a landscape, roaming
in the summer twilight; scenes in which
neither person nor scenery is a pretext for the
other, but each has its full share in arousing the
desired emotion. Such pictures are ascribed to,
or taken from Giorgione by succeeding critics,
but have all laid hold of his charm, and have
some share in his inspiration.</p>

<p>One of the ablest of his followers, a man whose
work is still confounded with the master&#8217;s, is
Cariani, the Bergamasque, who at different times
in his life also successfully imitated Palma and
Lotto. In his Giorgionesque manner Cariani often
creates charming figures and strong portraits,
though he pushes his colour to a coarse, excessive
tone. His family group in the Roncalli Collection
at Bergamo is very close to Giorgione. Seven
persons, three women and four men, are grouped
together upon a terrace, and behind them
stretches a calm landscape, half concealed by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>brocaded hanging. The effect of the whole is
restful, though it lacks Giorgione&#8217;s concentration
of sensation. Then, again, Cariani flies off to the
gayer, more animated style of Lotto. Later on,
when he tries to reproduce Giorgione&#8217;s pastoral
reveries, his shepherds and nymphs become mere
peasants, herdsmen, and country wenches, who
have nothing of the idyllic distinction which
Giorgione never failed to infuse. &ldquo;The
Adulteress before Christ&rdquo; at Glasgow still bears
the greater name, but its short, vulgar figures
and faulty composition disclaim his authorship,
while Cariani is fully capable of such failings,
and the exaggerated, red-brown tone is quite
characteristic of him.</p>

<p>These painters are more than merely imitative;
they are also typical. Giorgione&#8217;s new manner
had appealed to some quality inherent and
hereditary in their nature, and the essential traits
they single out and dwell upon are the traits
which appeal equally to the instincts of both.
It is this which makes their efforts more sympathetic
than those of other second-rate painters.
Colour, or rather the peculiar way in which
Giorgione used colour, made a natural appeal to
them, and it is a medium which does make an
immediate appeal and covers a multitude of shortcomings.</p>

<p>But Giorgione was not to leave his message
to the mercy of mere disciples and imitators,
however apt. Growing up around him were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>men to whom that message was an inspiration
and a trumpet-call, men who were to develop and
deepen it, endowing it with their own strength,
recognising that the way which the young
pioneer of Castelfranco had pointed out was the
one into which they could unhesitatingly pour
their whole inclination. The instinct for colour
was in their very blood. They turned to it with
the heart-whole delight with which a bird seeks
the air or a fish the water, and foremost among
them, to create and to consolidate, was the
mighty Titian.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>TITIAN</strong></p>


<p>The mountains of Cadore are not always visible
from Venice, but there they lie, behind the mists,
and in the clear shining after rain, in the golden
eventide of autumn, and on steel-cold winter
days they stand out, lapis-lazuli blue or deep
purple, or, like Shelley&#8217;s enchanted peaks, in
sharp-cut, beautiful shapes rising above billowy
slopes. Cadore is a land of rich chestnut woods,
of leaping streams, of gleams and glooms, sudden
storms and bursts of sunshine. It is an order of
scenery which enters deep into the affections of
its sons, and we can form some idea of the hold
its mingling of wild poetry and sensuous softness
obtained over the mind of Titian from the fact
that in after years, while he never exerts himself
to paint the city in which he lived and in which
all his greatest triumphs were gained, he is uniformly
constant to his mountain home, enters
into its spirit and interprets its charm with warm
and penetrating insight.</p>

<p>The district formed part of the dependencies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>of the great republic, and relied upon Venice for
its safety, its distinction, and in great measure
for its employment. The small craftsmen and
artists from all the country round looked forward
to going down to seek their fortune at her hands.
They tacked the name of their native town to
their own name, and were drawn into the
magnificent life of the city of the sea, and came
back from time to time with stories of her art,
her power, and beauty.</p>

<p>The Vecelli had for generations held honourable
posts in Cadore. The father and grandfather
of the young Tiziano were influential
men, and with his brother and sisters he must
have been brought up in comfort. There are
even traditions of noble birth, and it is evident
that Titian was always a gentleman, though this
did not prevent his being educated as a craftsman,
and when he was only ten years old he
was sent down to Venice to be apprenticed to
a mosaicist.</p>

<p>It was a changing Venice to which Titian
came as a boy; changing in its life, its social
and political conditions, and its art was faithfully
registering its aspirations and tastes. More
than at any previous time, it was calculated
to impress a youth to whom it had been held up
as the embodiment of splendid sovereignty, and
the difference between the little hill-town set in
the midst of its wild solitudes and the brilliant
city of the sea must have been dazzling and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>bewildering. A new sense of intellectual luxury
had awakened in the great commercial centre.
The Venetian love of splendour was displaying
itself by the encouragement and collection of
objects of art, and both ancient and modern
works were in increasing request. On Gentile
Bellini&#8217;s and Carpaccio&#8217;s canvases we see the sort
of people the Venetians were, shrewd, quiet,
splendour-loving, but business-like, the young
men fashionably dressed, fastidious connoisseurs,
splendid patrons of art and of religion. Buyers
were beginning to find out what a delightful
decoration the small picture made, and that it
was as much in place in their own halls as over
the altar of a chapel. The portrait, too, was
gaining in importance, and the idea of making it
a pleasure-giving picture, even more than a faithful
transcript, was gathering ground. The
&ldquo;Procession of the Relic&rdquo; was still in Gentile&#8217;s
studio, but the Frari &ldquo;Madonna and Child&rdquo;
was just installed in its place. Carpaccio was
beginning his long series of St. Ursula, and the
Bellini and Vivarini were in keen rivalship.</p>

<p>Titian is said to have passed from the <em>bottega</em>
of Gentile to that of Giovanni Bellini, but
nothing in his style reminds us of the former,
and even his early work has very little that is
really Bellinesque, whereas from the very first
he reflects the new spirit which emanated from
Giorgione. Titian was a year the elder, and
we can divine the sympathy that arose between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>the two when they came together in Bellini&#8217;s
School. As soon as their apprenticeship was at
an end they became partners. Fond of pleasure
and gaiety, loving splendour, dress, and amusement,
they were naturally congenial companions,
and were drawn yet more closely together by
their love for their art and by the aptitude with
which Titian grasped Giorgione&#8217;s principles.</p>

<p>And if we ask ourselves why we take for
granted that of two young men so closely allied
in age and circumstance we accept Giorgione
as the leader and the creator of the new style,
we may answer that Titian was a more complex
character. He was intellectual, and carried his
intellect into his art, but this was no new
feature. The intellect had had and was having
a large share in art. But in that part which was
new, and which was launching art upon an
untried course, Giorgione is more intense, more
one-idea&#8217;d than Titian. What he does he does
with a fervour and a spontaneity that marks him
as one who pours out the language of the heart.</p>

<p>The partnership between the two was probably
arranged a few years before the end of the
century, for we have seen that young painters
usually started on their own account at about
nineteen or twenty. For some years Titian, like
Giorgione, was engrossed by the decorations of
the Fondaco dei Tedeschi. The groups of
figures described by Zanetti in 1771 show us
that while Giorgione made some attempt at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>following classic figures, Titian broke entirely
with Greek art and only thought of picturesque
nature and contemporary costume.</p>

<p>Vasari complains that he never knew what
Titian&#8217;s &ldquo;Judith&rdquo; was meant to represent,
&ldquo;unless it was Germania,&rdquo; but Zanetti, who had
the benefit of Sebastiano Ricci&#8217;s taste, declares
that from what he saw, both Giorgione and
Titian gave proofs of remarkable skill. &ldquo;While
Giorgione showed a fervid and original spirit
and opened up a new path, over which he shed
a light that was to guide posterity, Titian was
of a grander and more equable genius, leaning
at first, indeed, upon Giorgione&#8217;s example, but
expanding with such force and rapidity as to
place him in advance of his companion, on an
eminence to which no later craftsman was
able to climb.... He moderated the fire of
Giorgione, whose strength lay in fanciful movement
and a mysterious artifice in disposing
shadows, contrasted darkly with warm lights,
blended, strengthened, blurred, so as to produce
the semblance of exuberant life.&rdquo; Certain works
remain to link the two painters; even now
critics are divided as to which of the two to
attribute the &ldquo;Concert&rdquo; in the Pitti. The
figures are Giorgionesque, but the technique
establishes it as an early Titian, and it is doubtful
whether Giorgione would be capable of the
intellectual effort which produced the dreamy,
passionate expression of the young monk, borne
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>far out of himself by his own melody, and half
recalled to life by the touch on his shoulder.
Titian, like Giorgione, was a musician, and the
fascination of music is felt by many masters
of the Italian schools. In one picture the player
feels vaguely after the melody, in another we are
asked to anticipate the song that is just about
to begin, or the last chords of that just finished
vibrate upon the ear, but nowhere else in all art
has any one so seized the melody of an instant
and kept its fulness and its passion sounding in
our ears as this musician does.</p>

<p>Though we cannot say that Titian was the
pupil of any one master, the fifteen years, more
or less, that he spent with Giorgione left an
indelible impression upon him. We have only
to look at such a picture as the &ldquo;Madonna and
Child with SS. John Baptist and Antony Abate,&rdquo;
in the Uffizi, an early work, to recollect that
in 1503 Giorgione at Castelfranco had taken
the Madonna from her niche in the sanctuary
and had enthroned her on high in a bright
and sunny landscape with S. Liberale standing
sentinel at her feet, like a knight guarding his
liege lady.</p>

<p>Titian in this early group casts every convention
aside; a beautiful woman and lovely
children are placed in surroundings whose charm
is devoid of hieratic and religious significance.
The same easy unfettered treatment appears in
the &ldquo;Madonna with the Cherries&rdquo; at Vienna,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>and the &ldquo;Madonna with St. Bridget and S.
Ulfus&rdquo; at Madrid, and while it has been surmised
that the example of the precise Albert
D&uuml;rer, who paid his first visit to Venice in
1506, was not without its effect in preserving
Titian from falling into laxity of treatment and
in inciting him to fine finish, it is interesting
to find that Titian was, in fact, discarding
the use of the carefully traced and transferred
cartoon, and was sketching his design freely on
panel or canvas with a brush dipped in brown
pigment, and altering and modifying it as he
went on.</p>

<p>The last years of Titian&#8217;s first period in
Venice must have been anxious ones. The
Emperor Maximilian was attacking the Venetian
possessions on the mainland, in anger at a refusal
to grant his troops a free passage on their way
to uphold German supremacy in Central Italy.
Cadore was the first point of his invasion, and
from 1507 Titian&#8217;s uncle and great-uncle were
in the Councils of the State, his father held an
important command, and his brother Francesco,
who had already made some progress as an
artist, threw down his brush and became a
soldier. Titian was not one of those who took
up arms, but his thoughts must have been full
of the attack and defence in his mountain
fastnesses, and he must have anxiously awaited
news of his father&#8217;s troops and of the squadrons
of Maso of Ferrara, under whose colours
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>Francesco was riding. Francesco made a reputation
as a distinguished soldier, and was severely
wounded, and when peace was made, Titian,
&ldquo;who loved him tenderly,&rdquo; persuaded him to
return to the pursuit of art.</p>

<p>The ratification of the League of Cambray, in
which Julius II., Maximilian, and Ferdinand of
Naples combined against the power of Venice, was
disastrous for a time to the city and to the artists
who depended upon her prosperity. Craftsmen
of all kinds first fled to her for shelter, then, as
profits and orders fell off, they left to look elsewhere
for commissions. An outbreak of plague,
in which Giorgione perished, went further to
make Venice an undesirable home, and at this
time Sebastian del Piombo left for Rome, Lotto
for the Romagna, and Titian for Padua.</p>

<p>We may believe that Titian never felt
perfectly satisfied with fresco-painting as a craft,
for when he was given a commission to fresco
the halls of the Santo, the confraternity of
St. Anthony, patron-saint of Padua, he threw off
beautifully composed and spirited drawings, but
he left the execution of them chiefly to assistants,
among whom the feeble Domenico Campagnola,
a painter whom he probably picked up at Padua,
is conspicuous. Even where the landscape is
best, as in &ldquo;S. Anthony restoring a Youth,&rdquo; the
drawing and composition only make us feel how
enchanting the scene would have been in oils
on one of Titian&#8217;s melting canvases. In those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>frescoes which he executed himself while his
interest was still fresh, the &ldquo;Miracle which
grants Speech to an Infant&rdquo; is the most Giorgionesque.
Up to this time he had preserved the
straight-cut corsage and the actual dress of his
contemporaries, after the practice of Giorgione;
he keeps, too, to his companion&#8217;s plan of design,
placing the most important figures upon one
plane, close to the frame and behind a low wall
or ledge which forms a sort of inner frame and
with a distant horizon. In the Paduan frescoes
he makes use of this plan, and the straight
clouds, the spindly trees, and the youths in gay
doublets are all reminiscent of his early comrade,
but the group of women to the left in the
&ldquo;Miracle of the Child&rdquo; shows that Titian is
beginning more decidedly to enunciate his own
type. The introduction of portraits proves that
he was tending to rely largely upon nature, in
contradistinction to Giorgione&#8217;s lyrically improvised
figures. He fuses the influence of
Giorgione and the influence of Antonello da
Messina and the Bellini in a deeper knowledge
of life and nature, and he is passing beyond
Giorgione in grasp and completeness. When
he was able to return to Venice, which he did in
1512, a temporary peace having been concluded
with Maximilian, he abandoned the uncongenial
medium of fresco for good, and devoted himself
to that which admitted of the afterthoughts,
the enrichments, the gradual attainment of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>exquisite surface, and at this time his works are
remarkable for their brilliant gloss and finish.</p>

<p>During the next twelve years we may group
a number of paintings which, taken in conjunction
with those of Giorgione, show the
true Venetian School at its most intense, idyllic
moment. They are the works of a man in the
pride of youth and strength, sane and healthy,
an example of the confident, sanguine, joyous
temper of his age, capable of embodying its
dominant tendencies, of expressing its enjoyment
of life, its worldly-mindedness, its love of
pleasure, as well as its noble feeling and its
grave and magnificent purpose.</p>

<p>For absolute delight in colour let us turn to
a picture like the &ldquo;Noli me tangere&rdquo; of the
National Gallery. The golden light, the blues
and olives of the landscape, the crimson of the
Magdalen&#8217;s raiment, combine in a feast of
emotional beauty, emphasising the feeling of
the woman, whose soul is breathed out in the
word &ldquo;Master.&rdquo; The colour unites with the
light and shadow, is embedded in it; and we
can see Titian&#8217;s delight in the ductile medium
which had such power to give material sensation.
In these liquid crimsons, these deep greens and
shoaling blues, the velvety fulness and plenitudes
of the brush become visible; we can look into
their depths and see something quite unlike the
smooth, opaque washes of the Florentines.</p>

<p>In such a masterpiece as &ldquo;Sacred and Profane
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>Love,&rdquo; painted during these years for the Borghese,
there are summed up all those artistic aims
towards which the Venetian painters had been
tending. The picture is still Giorgionesque in
mood. It may represent, as Dr. Wickhoff
suggests, Venus exhorting Medea to listen to the
love-suit of Jason; but the subject is not forced
upon us, and we are more occupied with the
contrast between the two beautiful personalities,
so harmoniously related to each other, yet so
opposed in type. The gracious, self-absorbed
lady, with her softly dressed hair, her loose glove,
her silvery satin dress, is a contrast in look and
spirit to the goddess whose free, simple attitude
and outward gaze embody the nobler ideal. The
sinuous and enchanting line of Venus&#8217;s figure
against the crimson cloak has, I think, been the
outcome of admiration for Giorgione&#8217;s &ldquo;Sleeping
Venus,&rdquo; and has the same soft, unhurried curves.
Titian&#8217;s two figures are perfectly spaced in a
setting which breathes the very aroma of the
early Renaissance. A bas-relief on the marble
fountain represents nymphs whipping a sleeping
Love to life, while a cupid teases the
chaste unicorn. A delicious baby Love splashes
in the water, fallen rose-leaves strew the
mellow marble rim, around and away stretches
a sunny country scene, in which people are
placidly pursuing a life of ease and pleasure.
What a revelation to Venice these pictures were
which began with Giorgione&#8217;s conversaziones!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>How little occupied the women are with the
story. Venus does not argue, or check off reasons
on her fingers, like S. Ursula. Medea is listening
to her own thoughts, but the whole scene
is bathed in the suggestion of the joy and
happiness of love. The little censer burning
away in the blue and breathless air might be a
philtre diffusing sensuous dreams, and when the
rays of the evening sun strike the picture,
where it now hangs, and bring out each touch
of its glowing radiance, it seems to palpitate
with the joy of life and to thrill with the
magic of summer in the days when the world
was young.</p>

<p>With the influence still lingering of Giorgione&#8217;s
&ldquo;Knight of Malta,&rdquo; Titian produced some of his
finest portraits in the decade that led to the
middle of his life. The &ldquo;Dr. Parma&rdquo; at Vienna,
the noble &ldquo;Man in Black&rdquo; and &ldquo;Man with a
Glove&rdquo; of the Louvre, the &ldquo;Young Englishman&rdquo;
of the Pitti, with his keen blue eyes, the
portrait at Temple Newsam, which, with some
critics, still passes as a Giorgione, are all examples
in which he keeps the half-length, invented by
Bellini and followed by Giorgione.</p>

<p>After the visit to Padua he shows less preference
for costume, and his women are generally
clothed in a loose white chemise, rather than
the square-cut bodice.</p>

<p>We do not wonder that all the leading
personages of Italy wished to be painted by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>Titian. His are the portraits of a man of
intellect. They show the subject at his best;
grave, cultivated, stately, as he appeared and
wished to appear; not taken off his guard in
any way. What can be more sympathetic as a
personality than the Ariosto of the National
Gallery? We can enter into his mind and make
a friend of him, and yet all the time he has
himself in hand; he allows us to divine as much
as he chooses, and draws a thin veil over all that
he does not intend us to discover. The painter
himself is impersonal and not over-sensitive; he
does not paint in his own fancies about his
sitter&mdash;probably he had none; he saw what he was
meant to see. There was what Mr. Berenson
calls &ldquo;a certain happy insensibility&rdquo; about him,
which prevented him from taking fantastic
flights, or from looking too deep below the
surface.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>TITIAN</strong> (<em>continued</em>)</p>


<p>With the &ldquo;Assumption,&rdquo; finished in 1518 for
the Church of the Frari, Titian rose to the
very highest among Renaissance painters. The
&ldquo;Glorious S. Mary&rdquo; was his theme, and he
concentrated all his efforts on the realisation of
that one idea. The central figure is, as it
were, a collective rather than an individual
type. Well proportioned and elastic as it is,
it has the abundance of motherhood. Harmonious
and serene, it combines dramatic force and
profound feeling. Exultant Humanity, in its
hour of triumph, rises with her, borne up lightly
by that throbbing company of child angels and
followed by full recognition and awestruck satisfaction
in the adoring gaze of the throng below,
yet Titian has contrived to keep some touch of
the loving woman hurrying to meet her son.
The flood of colour, the golden vault above, the
garment of glowing blues and crimsons, have
a more than common share in that spirit of
confident joy and poured-out life which envelops
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>the whole canvas. In the worthy representation
of a great event, the visible assumption of
Humanity to the Throne of God, Titian puts
forth all his powers and steeps us in that temper
of sanguine emotion, of belief in life and confidence
in the capacity of man, which was so
characteristic of the ripe Renaissance. In looking
at this splendid canvas, we must call to
mind the position for which Titian painted it.
Hung in the dusky recesses of the apse, it was
tempered by and merged in its stately surroundings.
The band of Apostles almost formed
a part of the whispering crowd below, and the
glorious Mother was beheld soaring upwards to
the golden light and the mysterious vistas of
the vaulted arches above.</p>

<p>The patronage of courts had by this time
altered the tenor of Titian&#8217;s life. In 1516
Duke Alfonso d&#8217;Este had invited him to Ferrara,
where he had finished Bellini&#8217;s &ldquo;Bacchanals.&rdquo;
It bears the marks of Titian&#8217;s hand, and he has
introduced a well-known point of view at Cadore
into the background. In 1518 Alfonso writes
to propose another painting, and Titian&#8217;s acceptance
is contained in a very courtier-like letter,
in which we divine a touch of irony. &ldquo;The
more I thought of it,&rdquo; he ends, &ldquo;the more I
became convinced that the greatness of art
among the ancients was due to the assistance
they received from great princes, who were
content to leave to the painter the credit and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>renown derived from their own ingenuity in
bespeaking pictures.&rdquo; Alfonso&#8217;s requirements
for his new castle were frankly pagan. Mythological
scenes were already popular. Mantegna
had adorned Isabela d&#8217;Este&#8217;s &ldquo;Paradiso&rdquo; with
revels of the gods, Botticelli had given his conception
of classic myth in the Medici villa, already
Bellini had essayed a Bacchanal, and Titian was
to make designs for similar scenes to complete
the decorations of the halls of Este. The same
exuberant feeling he shows in the &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo;
finds utterance in the &ldquo;Garden of Loves&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Bacchanals,&rdquo; both painted for Alfonso of
Ferrara. The children in the former may be
compared with the angels in the &ldquo;Assumption.&rdquo;
Their blue wings match the heavenly blue sky,
and they are painted with the most delicate finish.</p>

<p>We can imagine the beauty of the great
hall at Ferrara when hung with this brilliant
series, which was completed in 1523 by the
&ldquo;Bacchus and Ariadne&rdquo; of the National Gallery.
The whole company of bacchanals is given up
to wanton merrymaking. Above them broods
the deep blue sky and great white clouds of a
summer day. The deep greens of the foliage
throw the creamy-white and burning colour of
the draperies and the fair forms of the nymphs
into glowing relief, while by a convention
the satyrs are of a deep, tawny complexion.
On a roll of music is stamped the rollicking
device, &ldquo;<em>Chi boit et ne reboit, ne s&ccedil;eais que boir soit</em>.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>The purple fruit hangs ripened from the vines,
its crimson juice shines like a jewel in crystal
goblets and drips in streams over rosy limbs.
The influence of such pictures as these was
absorbed by Rubens, but though they hardly
surpass him in colour, they are more idyllic and
less coarse. The perfect taste of the Renaissance
is never shown more victoriously than here,
where indulgence ceases to be repulsive, and the
actors are real flesh and blood, yet more Arcadian
than revolting. In the &ldquo;Bacchus and Ariadne,&rdquo;
Titian gives triumphant expression to a mood
of wild rejoicing, so gay, so good-tempered, so
simple, that we must smile in sympathy. The
conqueror flinging himself from his golden
chariot drawn by panthers, his deep red mantle
fluttering on high, is so full of reckless life that
our spirit bounds with him. His rioting band,
marching with song and laughter, seems to
people that golden country-side with fit inhabitants.
The careless satyrs and little merry,
goat-legged fauns shock us no more than a herd
of forest ponies, tossing their manes and dashing
along for love of life and movement.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Yet almost
before this series was put in place Titian was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>showing the diversity of his genius by the
&ldquo;Deposition,&rdquo; now in the Louvre, which was
painted at the instance of the Gonzaga, Marquis
of Mantua and nephew of Alfonso d&#8217;Este. Here
he makes a great step in the use of chiaroscuro.
While it is satisfying in balance and sweeping
rhythm, and by the way in which every line
follows and intensifies the helpless, slackened
lines of the dead Body, it escapes Raphael&#8217;s
academic treatment of the same subject. Its
splendid colours are not noisy; they merge into
a scene of solemn pathos and tragedy. The
scene has a simplicity and unity in its passion,
and what above all gives it its intense power is
the way in which the flaming hues are absorbed
into the twilight shadows. The dark heads
stand out against the dying sunset, the pallor
of the dead is half veiled by the falling night.
It is a picture which has the emotional beauty
of a scene in nature, and makes a profound
impression by its depth and mystery. This
same solemnity and gravity temper the brilliant
colouring of the great altarpiece painted for
the Pesaro family in the Frari. Columns rise
like great tree-trunks, light and air play through
the clouds seen between them. The grouping
is a new experiment, but the way in which
the Mother and Child, though placed quite at
one side of the picture, are focussed as the
centre of interest, by the converging lines,
diagonal on the one hand and straight on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>other, crowns it with success. The scheme of
colour brings the two figures into high relief,
while St. Francis and the family of the donor
are subordinated to rich, deep tints. Titian has
abandoned, more completely than ever before,
any attempt to invest the Child with supernatural
majesty. He is a delightful, spoiled baby, fully
aware of his sovereignty over his mother, pretending
to take no notice of the kneeling suppliants,
but occupying himself in making a tent
over his head out of her veil. The &ldquo;Madonna
in Glory with six Saints&rdquo; of the Vatican is
another example of the rich and &ldquo;smouldering&rdquo;
colour in which Titian was now creating his great
altarpieces, kneading his pigments into a quality,
a solidity, which gives reality without heaviness,
and finishing with that fine-grained texture
which makes his flesh look like marble endowed
with life.</p>

(<em>The Medici Society, Ltd.</em>)</p>

<p>Venuses, altarpieces, and portraits all tell us
how boldly his own style was established. His
sacred persons are not different from his pagans
and goddesses. Yet though he has gone far, he
still reminds us of Giorgione. He has been
constant to the earliest influences which
surrounded him, and to that temperament which
made him accept those influences so
instantaneously&mdash;and this constancy and unity give
him the untroubled ascendancy over art which
is such a feature of his position.</p>

<p>With Leonardo and with Titian, painters had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>sprung to a recognised status in the great world
of the Renaissance. They were no longer the
patronised craftsmen. They had become the
courted guests, the social equals. Titian, passing
from the courts of Ferrara to those of Mantua
and Urbino, attended by a band of assistants,
was a magnificent personage, whose presence
was looked upon as a favour, and who undertook
a commission as one who conferred a coveted
boon. Among those who clustered closest round
the popular favourite, no one did more to
enhance his position than Aretino, the brilliant
unscrupulous debauchee, wit, bully, blackmailer,
but a man who, with all his faults, had evidently
his own power of fascination, and, the friend of
princes, must have been himself the prince of
good company. Aretino, as far as he could be
said to be attached to any one, was consistent in
his attachment to Titian from the time they
first met at the court of the Gonzaga. He
played the part of a chorus, calling attention to
the great painter&#8217;s merits, jogging the memory
of his employers as to payments, and never
ceasing to flatter, amuse, and please him. Titian,
for his part, shows himself equally devoted to
Aretino&#8217;s interests, and has left various characteristic
portraits of him, handsome and showy in
his prime, sensual and depraved as age overtook
him.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1528 the confraternity of
St. Peter Martyr invited artists to send in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>sketches for an altarpiece to their patron-saint,
in SS. Giovanni and Paolo, to replace an old one
by Jacobello del Fiore. Palma Vecchio and
Pordenone also competed, but Titian carried off
the prize. The picture was delivered in 1530,
and during the autumn of 1529 Sebastian del
Piombo had returned to Venice from Rome, and
Michelangelo had sought refuge there from
Florence and had stayed for some months. A
quarrel with the monks over the price had delayed
the picture, so that it may quite probably have
only been begun after intercourse with the
Roman visitors had given a fresh turn to Titian&#8217;s
ideas; for though he never ceases to be himself,
it certainly seems as if the genius of Michelangelo
had had some effect. From what we
know of the altarpiece, which perished by fire
in 1867, but of which a good copy by Cigoli
remains, Titian embarked suddenly upon forms
of Herculean strength in violent action, but
there his likeness to the Florentine ended;
the figures were, indeed, drawn with a deep,
though not altogether successful, attention to
anatomy and foreshortening, but the picture
obtained its effect and derived its impressiveness
from the setting in which the figures were
placed&mdash;the great trees, bending and straining,
the hurrying clouds, as if nature were in
portentous harmony with the sinister deed, and
overhead the enchanting gleam of light which
shot downward and irradiated the face of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>martyr and the two lovely winged boys, bathed
in a flood of blue &aelig;ther, who held aloft the palm
of victory. Many copies of it remain, and we
only regret that one which Rubens executed is
not preserved among them.</p>

<p>When we look at the delicious &ldquo;Madonna del
Coniglio&rdquo; in the Louvre and our own &ldquo;Marriage
of S. Catherine,&rdquo; the first of which certainly, and
the second probably, was painted about this time,
we cannot doubt that the charm of the idea
of motherhood had particularly arrested the
painter. About 1525 his first son, Pomponio,
was born, and was followed by another son and
a daughter. In the S. Catherine he paints that
passion of mother-love with an intensity and
reality that can only be drawn from life, and
on the wheel at her feet he has inscribed his
name, Ticianus, F. His feeling for landscape is
increasing, and the landscape in these pictures
equals the figures in importance and has engrossed
the painter quite as much. Every year
Titian paid a visit to Cadore, and in the rich
woodlands, the distant villages, the great white
villa on the hill-side, and, above all, in the far-off
blue mountains and the glooms and gleams of
storm and sunshine, the sudden dart of rays
through the summer clouds, which he has
painted here, we see how constant was his study
of his native country, and how profoundly he
felt its poetry and its charm. He had married
Cecilia, the daughter of a barber belonging to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Perarolo, a little town near Cadore. In 1530
she died, and he mourned her deeply. He
went on working and planning for his children&#8217;s
future, and his sister came from Cadore to take
charge of the motherless household; but his
friends&#8217; letters speak of his being ill from melancholy,
and he could not go on living in the
old house at San Samuele, which had been his
home for sixteen years. He took a new house
on the north side of the city, in the parish of
San Canciano. The Casa Grande, as it was
called, was a building of importance, which the
painter first hired and finally bought, letting off
such apartments as he did not need. The first
floor had a terrace, and was entered by a flight
of steps from the garden, which overlooked the
lagoons, and had a view of the Cadore mountains.
It has been swept away by the building of the
Fondamenta Nuove, but the documents of the
leases are preserved, and the exact site is well
established. Here his children grew up, and he
worked for them unceasingly. Pomponio, his
eldest son, was idle and extravagant, a constant
source of trouble, and Aretino writes him reproachful
letters, which he treats with much
impertinence. Orazio took to his father&#8217;s profession,
and was his constant companion, and often
drew his cartoons; and his beautiful daughter,
Lavinia, was his greatest joy and pride. In this
house Titian showed constant hospitality, and
there are records of the princely fashion in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>he entertained his friends and distinguished
foreign visitors. Priscianese, a well-known
Humanist and <em>savant</em> of the day, describes a
Bacchanalian feast on the 1st of August, in a
pleasant garden belonging to Messer Tiziano
Vecellio. Aretino, Sansovino, and Jacopo Nardi
were present. Till the sun set they stayed indoors,
admiring the artist&#8217;s pictures. &ldquo;As soon as
it went down, the tables were spread, looking on
the lagoons, which soon swarmed with gondolas
full of beautiful women, and resounded with
music of voices and instruments, which till
midnight, accompanied our delightful supper.
Titian gave the most delicate viands and precious
wines, and the supper ended gaily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the year 1532 Titian for the first time
sought other than Italian patronage. Charles V.,
who was then at the height of his power, with
all Italy at his feet, passed through Mantua,
and among all the treasures that he saw was
most struck by Titian&#8217;s portrait of Federigo
Gonzaga. After much writing to and fro, it was
arranged that Titian should meet the Emperor
at Bologna, where he had just been crowned.
He made his first sketch of him, from which he
afterwards produced a finished full length. It
was the first of many portraits, and Vasari declares
that from that time forth Charles would never sit
to any other master. He received a knighthood,
and many commissions from members of the
Emperor&#8217;s court. It was for one of his nobles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>da Valos, Marquis of Vasto, that he painted the
allegorical piece in the Louvre, in which Mary
of Arragon, the lovely wife of da Valos, is
parting with her husband, who is bound on one
of the desperate expeditions against the terrible
Turks. Da Valos is dressed in armour, and the
couple are encircled by Hymen, Victory, and
the God of Love. The composition was repeated
more than once, but never with quite the same
success. We again suspect the influence of
Michelangelo in the altarpiece painted before
Titian next left Venice, of St. John the Almsgiver,
for the Church of that name, of which the Doge
was patron. The figures are life-size, the types
stern and rugged, daringly foreshortened, and
the colours, though gorgeous, are softened and
broken by broad effects of light and shade. It
is painted in a solemn mood, a contrast to that
in which about this time he produced a series of
beautiful female portraits, nude or semi-nude,
chiefly, it would appear, at the instance of the
Duke of Urbino. The Duke at this time was
the General-in-Chief of the Venetian forces, a
position which took him often to Venice, and
Titian&#8217;s relations with him lasted till the painter&#8217;s
death. At least twenty-five of his works must
have adorned the castles of Urbino and Pesaro.
Among these were the Venus of the Uffizi, &ldquo;La
Bella di Tiziano,&rdquo; in her gorgeous scheme of
blue and amethyst, the &ldquo;Girl in a Fur Cloak,&rdquo;
besides portraits of the Duke and Duchess. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>would be impossible to enumerate here the
numbers of portraits which Titian was now
supplying. The reputation he had acquired,
not only in Italy, but in Spain, France, and
Germany, was greater than had ever been attained
by any painter, while his social position was
established among the highest in every court.
&ldquo;He had rivals in Venice,&rdquo; says Vasari,
&ldquo;but none that he did not crush by his
excellence and knowledge of the world in
converse with gentlemen.&rdquo; There is not a
writer of the day who does not acclaim his
genius. Titian was undoubtedly very fond of
money, and had amassed a good fortune. He
was constantly asking for favours, and had
pensions and allowances from royal patrons.
Lavinia, when she married, brought her husband
a dowry of 1400 ducats. He had painted the
portraits of the Doges with tolerable regularity,
but all through his life complaints were heard of
his neglect of the work of the Hall of Grand
Council. Occupied as he was with the work of his
foreign patrons, he had systematically neglected
the conditions enjoined by his possession of a
Broker&#8217;s patent, and the Signoria suddenly called
on him to refund the salary amounting to over
100 ducats a year, for the twenty years during
which he had drawn it without performing his
promise, while they prepared to instal Pordenone,
who had lately appeared as his bitter rival, in
his stead. Though Titian must have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>making large sums of money at this time, his
expenses were heavy, and he could not calmly face
the obligation to repay such a sum as 2000 ducats
at the same time that he lost the annual salary,
nor was it pleasant to be ousted by a second-rate
rival. His easy remedy was, however, in his
own hands; he set to work and soon completed
a great canvas of the &ldquo;Battle of Cadore,&rdquo; which,
though it is only known to us from a contemporary
print and a drawing by Rubens,
evidently deserved Vasari&#8217;s verdict of being the
finest battlepiece ever placed in the hall. The
movement and stir he contrives to give with a
small number of figures is astonishing. The
fortress burns upon the hill-side, a regiment
advancing with lances and pennons produces the
illusion that it is the vanguard of a great army, the
desperate conflict by the narrow bridge realises
all the terrors of war. It was an atonement for
his long period of neglect, but it was not till
<ins class="translit" title="Pordenone died in 1539">1439</ins> that, Pordenone having suddenly died, the
Signoria relented and reinstated Titian in his
Broker&#8217;s patent. One of his later paintings for the
State still keeps its place, &ldquo;The Triumph of
Faith,&rdquo; in which Doge Grimani, a splendid, steel-clad
form with flowing mantle, kneels before the
angelic apparition of Faith, who holds a cross,
which angels and cherubs help her to support.
Beneath the clouds are seen the Venetian fleet, the
Ducal Palace, and the Campanile. It is an allegory
of Grimani&#8217;s life; his defeat and captivity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>are symbolised by the cross and chalice, and the
magnificent figure of St. Mark with the lion is
introduced to show that the Doge believes himself
to owe his freedom to the saint&#8217;s intercession.
The prophet and standard-bearer at the sides
were added by Marco Vecellio.</p>

<p>Though the battlepiece perished in the fire
of 1577, another masterpiece of this time marks
a climax in Titian&#8217;s brilliantly coloured and
highly finished style. The &ldquo;Presentation of the
Virgin&rdquo; was painted for the refectory of the
Confraternity of the Carit&agrave;, which was housed in
the building now used as the Academy, so that
the picture remains in the place for which it
was executed. It is one of the most vivid and
life-like of all his works. The composition is
the traditional one; the fifteen steps of the
&ldquo;Gospel of Mary,&rdquo; the High Priest of the old
dispensation welcoming the childish representative
of the new. Below is a great crowd, but
it is this little figure which first attracts the
eye. The contrast between the mass of architecture
and the free and glowing country beyond
is not without meaning, and a broken Roman
torso, lying neglected on the ground, symbolises
the downfall of the Pagan Empire. The flight
of steps, with the figure sitting below them, is an
idea borrowed from Carpaccio, and perhaps taken
by him from the sketch-book of Jacopo Bellini.
The men on the left are portraits of members and
patrons of the confraternity. Most Titianesque
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>are the beautiful women in rich dresses at the
foot of the steps. In this stately composition
we see what is often noticeable in Titian&#8217;s
scenes; he brings in the bystanders after the
manner of a Greek chorus. They all, with one
accord, express the same sentiment. There is a
certain acceptation of the obvious in Titian, a
vein of simplicity flows through his nature. He
has not the sensitive and subtle search after the
motives of humanity which we find in Tintoretto
or Lotto. He has great intellectual power, but
not great imagination. It is a temper which
helps to keep the unity, the monumental quality
of his scenes undisturbed and adds to their effect.
In the &ldquo;Ecce Homo&rdquo; Christ is shown to the
populace by Pilate, who with dubious compliment
is a portrait of Aretino, and the contrast of
the lonely, broken-down man with the crowd
which, with all its lower instincts let loose,
thunders back the cry of &ldquo;Crucify Him,&rdquo; is the
more dramatic because of the unanimous spirit
which possesses the raging multitude. Other
artists would have given more incidental byplay,
and drawn off our attention from the main issue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>TITIAN</strong> (<em>continued</em>)</p>


<p>While Titian was executing portraits of the
Doges, of Aretino and of Isabella of Portugal,
and of himself and his daughter Lavinia, he
was also striking out a new line in the ceiling
pictures for the Church of San Spirito, which
have since been transferred to the Salute.
Though painted before his journey to Rome,
it may be suspected that he had Michelangelo&#8217;s
work in the Sixtine Chapel in mind, and that
he was setting himself the task of bold foreshortening
and technical problems. The daring
of the conception is great, yet we feel sure that
this is not Titian&#8217;s element; his figures in violent
movement give a vivid idea of strength and muscular
force, but fail both in grace and drawing,
and though the colour and light and shade distract
our attention from defects of form, he does
not possess that mastery over the flowing silhouette
which Tintoretto attained.</p>

<p>It was in 1543 that his relations with the
Farnese, whose young cardinal he had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>painting, drew him at last to Rome. Leo X.
had tried to attract him there without success,
but now at sixty-eight he found himself as far
on the road as Urbino. His son Orazio was
with him, and Duke Guidobaldo was himself
his escort, and sent him on with a band of
men-at-arms from Pesaro. He was received in
Rome by Cardinal Bembo; Paul III. gave him
a cordial welcome and Vasari was appointed
his cicerone. It is interesting to inquire what
impression Rome, with its treasures of antique
statuary and contemporary painting, made upon
Titian. &ldquo;He is filled with wonder and glad
that he came,&rdquo; writes Bembo. In a letter to
Aretino he regrets that he had not come before.
He stayed eight months in Rome, and was made
a Roman citizen. He visits the Stanze of
Raphael in company with Sebastian del Piombo,
and Michelangelo comes to see him at his
lodgings, and he receives a long letter from
Aretino advising him to compare Michelangelo
with Raphael, and Sansovino and Bramante with
the sculptors and architects of antiquity. Titian
was well established in his own style, and was
received as the creator of acknowledged masterpieces,
and he never painted a more magnificent
portrait-piece than that of Paul III., the peevish
old Pope, ailing and humorous, suspicious of the
two nephews who are painted with him, and
who he guessed to be conspiring against him.
The characteristic attitude of the old man of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>eighty, bent down in his chair, his quick,
irritable glance, the steady, determined gaze of
the cardinal, the obsequious attitude and weak,
wily face of Ottavio Farnese are all immortalised
in a broader, more careless technique than Titian
has hitherto used. Though he does not seem
to have been directly influenced by all he saw in
Rome, we undoubtedly find a change coming over
his work between 1540 and 1550, which may
be in part ascribed to a widening of his artistic
horizon and a consciousness of what others were
doing, both around him and abroad. In its
whole handling and character his late is different
from his early manner. It begins at this time
to take on a blurred, soft, impressionist character.
His delight in rich colouring seems to wane,
and he aims at intensifying the power of light.
He reaches that point in the Venetian School
of painting which we may regard as its climax,
when there is little strong local colour, but the
canvas seems illumined from within. There
are no clear-cut lines, but the shapes are
suggested by sombre enveloping shades in
which the radiant brightness is embedded. His
landscapes alter too; they are no longer blue
and smiling, filled with loving detail, but
grander, more mysterious. In the &ldquo;St. Jerome&rdquo;
in Paris the old Saint kneels in wild and lonely
surroundings, and the moon, slowly rising behind
the dark trees, sends a sharp, silver ray across
the crucifix. The &ldquo;Supper at Emmaus&rdquo; has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>the grandiose effect that is given by avoidance
of detail and simplification of method.</p>

<p>Titian painted several portraits of himself, and
we know what sort of stately figure was presented
by the old man of seventy who, at Christmas in
1547, set forth to ride across the Alps in the
depths of winter to obey Charles V.&#8217;s call to Augsburg.
The excitement of the public was great at
his departure, and Aretino describes how his house
was besieged for the sketches and designs he left
behind him. For nearly forty years Titian was
employed by the House of Hapsburg. He had
been working for Charles since 1530, and when
the Emperor abdicated, his employment by Philip
II. lasted till his death. The palace inventory of
1686 contained seventy-six Titians, and though
probably not all were genuine, yet an immense
number were really by him, and the gallery,
even now, is richer in his works than any other.</p>

<p>The great hall of the Pardo must have been
a wonderful sight, with Titian&#8217;s finest portrait
of himself in the midst, and the magnificent
portraits and sacred and allegorical pieces which
he continued from this time forward to contribute
to it. In this year, which was the
last before Charles&#8217;s abdication, and during this
visit to South Germany, he painted the great
equestrian portrait of the Emperor on the field
of M&uuml;hlberg, and two years later came the first
of his many portraits of Philip II. The face,
in the first sketch, is laid in with a sort of fury
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>of impressionism, and in the parade portrait the
sitter is realised as a man of great distinction.
Ugly and sensual as he is, we never tire of
looking at Titian&#8217;s conception&mdash;a full length of
distinguished mien rendered attractive by magnificent
colour. Everything in it lives, and the
slender, aristocratic hands are, as Morelli says, a
whole biography in themselves.</p>

<p>The splendid series of allegorical subjects
which Titian contributed to the Pardo, while he
was still supplying sacred pictures and altarpieces
to Venice and the neighbouring mainland, are
among his most mature and important works.
Never has his gamut of tones been fuller and
stronger than in the &ldquo;Jupiter and Antiope,&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;Venus of the Pardo&rdquo; as it is sometimes
called. The Venus herself has the attitude of
Giorgione&#8217;s dreaming goddess, with her arm
flung up above her head. It is, perhaps, the only
time that Titian succeeds in giving anything
ideal to one of his Venuses. The famous nudes
of the Uffizi and the Louvre are splendid
courtesans, far removed from Giorgione&#8217;s idyllic
vision; but Antiope, slumbering on her couch
of skins, and her woodland lover, gazing with
adoring eyes on her beautiful face, have a whole
world of sweet and joyful fancy. The whole
scene is full of a <em>joie de vivre</em>, which carries us
back to the Bacchanals painted so many years
before, and in these Titian gives King Philip
his most perfect work, every touch of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>is his own. This picture, now in the Louvre,
was given to Charles I. by the King of Spain,
and bought for Cardinal Mazarin in 1650.
&ldquo;Dana&euml;,&rdquo; &ldquo;Venus and Adonis,&rdquo; &ldquo;Europa and
the Bull,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo; followed in
quick succession, but Titian was now employing
many assistants, and great parts of the canvases
issuing from his workshop show weak, imitative
hands, while replicas were made of other works.</p>

<p>His later feeling for the religious in art is
expressed in the now bedimmed paintings in
San Salvatore in Venice. Vasari describes these
in 1566. Painted when Titian was nearly ninety
years old, the &ldquo;Transfiguration&rdquo; is remarkable
for forcible, majestic movement, while in the
&ldquo;Annunciation&rdquo; he invents quite a new treatment.
Mary turns round and raises her veil,
while she grasps the book as if she depended on
it for stay and support. The four angels are
full of life and gaiety, and the whole has much
grace and colour, though it is dashed in, in
the painter&#8217;s later style, in broad and sweeping
planes without patience of detail. The old man
has signed it &ldquo;Titianus, fecit, fecit,&rdquo; a contemptuous
reply to some critics who complained
of its want of finish. He knew well what it
was in composition and execution, and that all
that he had ever known or done lay within the
careless strength of his last manner.</p>

<p>A letter written to the King of Spain&#8217;s
secretary in 1574 gives a list &ldquo;in part&rdquo; of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>fourteen pictures sent to Madrid during the
last twenty-five years, &ldquo;with many others which
I do not remember.&rdquo; On every hand we hear
of lost pictures from the master&#8217;s brush, and the
number produced even during the last ten years
of his life must have been enormous, for till
the end he was full of great undertakings and
achievements. Very late in life he painted a
&ldquo;Shepherd and Nymph&rdquo; (Vienna), which in
its idyllic feeling, its slumberous delight, its
mingling of clothed and nude figures, recalls the
early days with Giorgione, yet the blurred and
smouldering richness, the absolute negation of
all sharp lines and lights is in his very latest
style, and he has gone past Giorgione on his
own ground. Then in strange contrast is the
&ldquo;Christ Crowned with Thorns,&rdquo; at Vienna, a
tragic figure stupefied with suffering. His last
great work was the &ldquo;Piet&agrave;&rdquo; in the Academy,
which, though unfinished, is nobly designed and
very impressive. He places the Virgin supporting
the Body in a great dome-shaped niche,
which gives elevation. It is flanked by two
calm, antique, stone figures, whose impassive air
contrasts with the wild pain and grief below.
The Magdalen steps out towards the spectator
with the wailing cry of a Greek tragedy. It
perhaps hardly moves us like the concentrated
feeling of Bellini&#8217;s Madonna, or the hurried,
trembling grief of Tintoretto&#8217;s Magdalen, but
it is monumental in the sweeping grace of its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>line, and full of nobility of feeling. It is
sadly rubbed and darkened and has lost much
of Titian&#8217;s colour, but is still beautiful in
its deep greys mingled with a sombre golden
glow, as of half-extinguished fires. These late
paintings are of the true impressionist order;
looked at closely they present a mass of scumbled
touches, of incoherent dashes, but if we step
farther away, to the right focus, light and dark
arrange themselves, order shines through the
whole, and we see what the great master meant
us to see. &ldquo;Titian&#8217;s later creations,&rdquo; says
Vasari, &ldquo;are struck off rapidly, so that when
close you cannot see them, but afar they look
perfect, and this is the style which so many
tried to imitate, to show that they were practised
hands, but only produced absurdities.&rdquo; Titian
was preparing the picture for the Frari, in payment
for the grant of a tomb for himself, when
in August 1576 the plague broke out in Venice,
and on the 27th the great painter died of it in
his own house. The stringent regulations concerning
infection were relaxed to do honour to
one of the greatest sons of Venice, and he was
laid to rest in the Frari, borne there in solemn
procession, through a city stricken by terror and
panic, and buried in the Chapel of the Crucified
Saviour, for which his last work was ordered.
The &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo; of his prime looked down
upon him, and close at hand was the &ldquo;Madonna
of Casa Pesaro.&rdquo; His son Orazio caught the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>plague and died immediately after, and the
painter&#8217;s house was sacked by thieves and many
precious things stolen.</p>

<p>The great personality of Titian stands out
as that which of all others established and
consolidated the school of Venice. He is its
central figure. The century of life, of which
eighty years were passed in ceaseless industry of
production, left its deep impression on the art of
every civilised country of Europe. Every great
man of the day who was a lover of art and
culture fell under Titian&#8217;s spell. His influence
on his contemporaries was enormous, and he had
everything: genius, industry, personal distinction,
character, social charm. He is, perhaps, of too
intellectual a cast of mind to be quite typical of
the Venetian spirit, in the way that Tintoretto
is; it is conceivable that in another environment
Titian might have developed on rather
different lines, but this temper gave him greater
domination. He was free from the eccentricities
which beset genius. He possessed the saving
salt of practical common sense, so that the
golden mean of sanity and healthful joy in his
works commended them to all men, and they are
not difficult to understand. Yet while all can
see the beauty of his poetic instinct for colour,
his interesting and original technique, his grasp
and scope, his mastery and certainty have gained
for him the title of &ldquo;the painter&#8217;s painter.&rdquo;
There is no one from whom men feel that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>can so safely learn so much, and the grand breadth
and power of elimination of his later years is
justified by the way in which in his earlier work
he has carried exquisite finish and rich impasto
to perfection.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>PALMA VECCHIO AND LORENZO LOTTO</strong></p>


<p>Among the many who clustered round Titian&#8217;s
long career, Palma attained to a place beside him
and Giorgione which his talent, which was not
of the highest order, scarcely warranted. But
he was classed with the greatest, and influenced
contemporary art because his work chimed in
so well with the Venetian spirit. A Bergamasque
by birth, he came of Venetian parentage, and
learnt the first elements of his art in Venice.
He never really mastered the inner niceties of
anatomy in its finest sense, and the broad
generalisation of his forms may be meant
to conceal uncertain drawing, but his large-bosomed,
matronly women and plump children,
his round, soft contours, his clean brilliancy, and
the clear golden polish in which his pictures
are steeped, made a great appeal to the public.
His invention is the large Santa Conversazione,
as compared with those in half-length of the
earlier masters. The Virgin and saints and
kneeling or bending donors are placed under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>the spreading trees of a rich and picturesque
landscape. It is Palma&#8217;s version of the Giorgionesque
ideal, which he had his share in establishing
and developing. The heavy tree-trunk and
dark foliage, silhouetted almost black against
the background, are characteristic of his compositions.
As his life goes on, though he still
clings to his full, ripe figures and to the same
smooth fleshiness in his women, the features
become delicate and chiselled, and the more
refined type and subtler feeling of his middle
stage may be due to his companionship with
Lotto, with whom he was in Bergamo when
they were both about twenty-five. He touches
his highest, and at the same time keeps very
near Giorgione, in the splendid St. Barbara,
painted for the company of the <em>Bombadieri</em> or
artillerists. Their cannon guard the pedestal on
which she stands; it was at her altar that they
came to commend themselves on going forth to
war, and where they knelt to offer thanksgiving
for a safe return; and she is a truly noble figure,
regal in conception and fine and firm in execution,
attired in sumptuous robes of golden brown and
green, with splendid saints on either hand.
Palma was often approached by his patrons who
wanted mythological scenes, gods, and goddesses;
but though he produced a Venus, a handsome,
full-blown model, he never excels in the nude, and
his tendency is to seize upon the homely. His
scenes have a domestic, familiar flavour. With
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>all his golden and ivory beauty he lacks fire, and
his personages have a sluggish, plethoric note. In
his latest stage he hides all sharpness in a sort of
scumble or haze. It would, however, be unfair
to say he is not fine, and his portraits especially
come very near the best. Vienna is rich in
examples in half-lengths of one beautiful woman
after another robed in the ample and gorgeous
garments in which he is always interested.
Among them is his handsome daughter,
Violante, with a violet in her bosom, and
wearing the large sleeves he admires. The
&ldquo;Tasso&rdquo; of the National Gallery has been taken
from him and given first to Giorgione and then
to Titian, but there now seems some inclination
to return it to its first author. It has a more
dreamy, intellectual countenance than we are
accustomed to associate with Palma; but he uses
elsewhere the decorative background of olive
branches, and the waxen complexion, tawny
colouring, and the pronounced golden haze are
Palmesque in the highest degree. The colouring
is in strong contrast to the pale ivory glow of
the Ariosto of Titian, which hangs near it.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Palma Vecchio.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOLY FAMILY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Colonna Gallery, Rome.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p>No one could be more unlike Palma than his
contemporary, Lorenzo Lotto, who has for long
been classed with the Bergamasques, but who
is proved by recently discovered documents to
have been born in Venice. It was for long an
accepted fact that Lotto was a pupil of Bellini, and
his earliest altarpiece, to S. Cristina at Treviso,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>bears traces of Bellini&#8217;s manner. A Piet&agrave; above
has child angels examining the wounds with the
grief and concern which Bellini made so peculiarly
his own, and the St. Jerome and the branch of
fig-leaves silhouetted against the light remind
us of the altarpiece in S. Crisostomo. Lotto
seems to have clung to quattrocento fashions.
The ancona had long been rejected by most of
his contemporaries, but he painted one of the
last for a church in Recanati, in carved and
gilt compartments, and he painted predellas long
after they had become generally obsolete. We
ask ourselves how it was that Lotto, who had so
susceptible and easily swayed a nature, escaped
the influence of Giorgione, the most powerful
of any in the Venice of his youth&mdash;an influence
which acted on Bellini in his old age, which
Titian practically never shook off, and which
dominated Palma to the exclusion of any earlier
master.</p>

<p>It would take too long to survey the train of
argument by which Mr. Berenson has established
Alvise Vivarini as the master of Lotto. Notwithstanding
that Bellini&#8217;s great superiority was
becoming clear to the more cultured Venetians,
Alvise, when Lotto was a youth, was still the
painter <em>par excellence</em> for the mass of the public.
In the S. Cristina altarpiece the Child standing
on its Mother&#8217;s knee is in the same attitude as
the Child in Alvise&#8217;s altarpiece of 1480, and the
Mother&#8217;s hand holds it in the same way. Other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>details which supply internal evidence are the
shape of hands and feet, the round heads and the
way the Child is often represented lying across
the Mother&#8217;s knees. Lotto carries into old age
the use of fruit and flowers and beads as decoration,
a Squarcionesque feature beloved of the
Vivarini, but which was never adopted by Bellini.</p>

<p>About 1512 Lotto comes into contact with
Palma, and for a short time the two were in close
touch. A &ldquo;Santa Conversazione,&rdquo; of which a
good copy exists in Villa Borghese, Rome, and one
at Dresden, with the Holy Family grouped under
spreading trees, is saturated with Palma&#8217;s spirit,
but it soon passes away, and except for an
occasional touch, disappears entirely from Lotto&#8217;s
work.</p>

<p>Lotto may have had relations in Bergamo,
for when in 1515 a competition between artists
was set on foot by Alessandro Martino, a
descendant of General Colleone, for an altarpiece
for S. Stefano, he competed and carried
off the prize. This was the first of the series
of the great works for Bergamo, which enrich
the little city, where at this period he can best
be studied. The great altarpiece (now removed
to San Bartolommeo) is a most interesting
human document, a revelation of the
painter&#8217;s personality. He does not break away
from hieratic conventions, like the rival school;
his Madonna is still placed in the apse of the
church with saints grouped round her, a form
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>from which the Vivarini never departed, but
the whole is full of intense movement, of a
lyric grace and ecstasy, a desire to express
fervent and rapturous devotion. The architectural
background is not in happy proportion
in relation to the figures, but the effect of vista
and space is more remarkable than in any North
Italian master. The vivid treatment of light
and shade, and the gaiety and delicacy of the
flying angels, who hold the canopy, and of the
putti, who spread the carpet below, the shapes
of throne and canopy and the decorations have
led to the idea that Lotto drew his inspiration
from Correggio, whom he certainly resembles
in some ways; but at this time Correggio was
only twenty, and had not given any examples
of the style we are accustomed to call Correggiesque.
We must look back to a common origin
for those decorative details, which are so conspicuous
in Crivelli and Bartolommeo Vivarini,
which came to Lotto through the Vivarini and
to Correggio through Ferrarese painters, and of
which the fountain-head for both was the school
of Squarcione. For the much more striking
resemblances of composition and spirit, the explanation
seems to be that Lotto on one side
of his nature was akin to Correggio; he had
the same lyrical feeling, the same inclination
to exuberance and buoyancy. To both, painting
was a vehicle for the expression of feeling,
but Lotto had also common sense and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>goodly share of that humour that is allied to
pathos.</p>

<p>Till the year 1526 Lotto was much in
Bergamo, where the first altarpiece gained him
orders for others. The reputation of a member
of the school of Venice was a sure passport to
employment. We trace Alvise&#8217;s tradition very
plainly in the altarpiece in San Bernardino,
where the gesture of the Madonna&#8217;s hand as she
expounds to the listening saints recalls Alvise&#8217;s of
1480. The little gathered roses, which Lotto
makes use of to the end of his life, lie scattered
on the step; angels, daringly foreshortened, sweep
aside the curtain of the sanctuary. The colour
is in Lotto&#8217;s scarlet, light blues, and violet.
He soon shows himself fond of genre incidents,
and in &ldquo;Christ taking leave of His Mother&rdquo;
gives a view into a bedroom and a cat running
across the floor. The donor kneels with her
hair fashionably dressed and wearing a pearl
necklace. In the &ldquo;Marriage of S. Catherine&rdquo;
at Bergamo the saint is evidently a portrait,
with hair pearl-wreathed. She kneels very
simply and naturally before the Child, and the
exquisitely lovely and elaborately gowned young
woman who represents the Madonna, looks
out towards the spectator with a mundane
and curiously modern air. It was probably
the recognition of Lotto&#8217;s success with portraits
that led to their being so often introduced
into his sacred pieces. In the one we have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>just noticed, the donor, Niccolas Bonghi, is
brought in, and is on rather a larger scale
than the rest, but Lotto has evidently not
found him interesting. The portraits of the
brothers della Torre, and that of the Prothonotary
Giuliano in the National Gallery, inaugurate
that wonderful series of characterisations
which are his greatest distinction. A series of
frescoes in village churches round Bergamo
must also be noticed. They are remarkable
for spontaneous and original decoration, and
may compare with the ceremonial groups of
Gentile Bellini and Carpaccio. Lotto&#8217;s personages,
as they chatter in the market-places, are
full of natural animation and gaiety, and we
realise what a step had been made in the
painting of actual life.</p>

<p>Owing to the unsettled state of the rest of
Italy, the years from 1530 to 1540, which Lotto
spent in Venice, found that city the gathering-ground
of many of the most distinguished
scholars and deepest thinkers of the day. Men
of all shades of religious thought were engaged
in learned discussion, and Lotto&#8217;s ardent and
inquiring temperament must have been stimulated
by such an environment. During these
years, too, he became intimate with Titian, and
experimented in Titian&#8217;s style, with the result
that his painting gets thicker and richer, more
fused and solid, and his figures are better put
together. He imitates Titian&#8217;s colour, too, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>it makes him paint in deeper, fiercer tints, and
he soon finds it does not suit him, and returns
to his own scheme. His colour is still rather
too dazzling, but the distances are translucent
and atmospheric. He continues to introduce
portraits. In his altarpiece in SS. Giovanni
and Paolo the deacons giving alms and receiving
petitions curiously resemble in type and expression
the ecclesiastics we see to-day.</p>

<p>Lotto was now an accepted member of
Titian&#8217;s set, and Aretino, in a letter dated 1548,
writes that Titian values his taste and judgment
as that of no other; but Aretino, with his usual
mixture of connoisseurship and clever spite, goes
on to insinuate accidentally, as it were, what he
himself knew perfectly well, that Lotto was
not considered on a par with the masters of
the first rank. &ldquo;Envy is not in your breast,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;rather do you delight to see in other
artists certain qualities which you do not find
in your own brush, ... holding the second
place in the art of painting is nothing compared
to holding the first place in the duties of
religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An interesting codex or commentary tells us
that Lotto never received high prices for his
work, and we hear of him hawking pictures about
in artistic circles, putting them up in raffles, and
leaving a number with Jacopo Sansovino in the
hope that he might hear of buyers. His work
ended as it had begun, in the Marches. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>undertook commissions at Recanati, Ancona, and
Loreto, and in September 1554 he concluded a
contract with the Holy House at Loreto, by
which, in return for rooms and food, he made
over himself and all his belongings to the care
of the fraternity, &ldquo;being tired of wandering,
and wishing to end his days in that holy place.&rdquo;
He spent the last four years of his life at Loreto
as a votary of the Virgin, painting a series of
pictures which are distinguished by the same sort
of apparent looseness and carelessness which we
noticed in Titian&#8217;s late style; a technique which,
as in Titian&#8217;s case, conceals a profound knowledge
of plastic modelling.</p>

<p>Though Lotto executed an immense number
of important and very beautiful sacred works,
his portraits stand apart, and are so interesting
to the modern mind that one is tempted to
linger over them. Other painters give us finer
pictures; in none do we feel so anxious to know
who the sitters were and what was their story.
Lotto has nothing of the Pagan quality which
marks Giorgione and Titian; he is a born
psychologist, and as such he witnesses to an
attitude of mind in the Italy of his day which
is of peculiar interest to our own. Lotto&#8217;s bystanders,
even in his sacred scenes, have nothing
in common with Titian&#8217;s &ldquo;chorus&rdquo;; they have the
characterisation of distinct individuals, and when
he is concerned with actual portraits he is intensely
receptive and sensitive to the spirit of his sitters.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>He may be said to &ldquo;give them away,&rdquo; and to
take an almost unfair advantage of his perception.
The sick man in the Doria Gallery looks
like one stricken with a death sentence. He
knows at least that it is touch and go, and
the painter has symbolised the situation in the
little winged genius balancing himself in a pair
of scales. In the Borghese Gallery is the portrait
of a young, magnificently dressed man, with a
countenance marked by mental agitation, who
presses one hand to his heart, while the other
rests on a pile of rose-petals in which a tiny
skull is half-hidden. The &ldquo;Old Man&rdquo; in the
Brera has the hard, narrow, but intensely sad
face of one whose natural disposition has been
embittered by the circumstances of his life, just
as that of our Prothonotary speaks of a large and
gentle nature, mellowed by natural affections and
happy pursuits. We smile, as Lotto does, with
kindly mischief at &ldquo;Marsilio and his Bride;&rdquo; the
broad, placid countenance of the man is so significantly
contrasted with the clever mouth and
eyes of the bride that it does not need the
malicious glance of the cupid, who is fitting on
the yoke, to &ldquo;dot the i&#8217;s and cross the t&#8217;s&rdquo; of their
future. Again, the portrait of Laura di Pola, in
the Brera, introduces us to one of those women
who are charming in every age, not actually
beautiful, but harmonious, thoughtful, perfectly
dressed, sensible, and self-possessed, and the
&ldquo;Family Group&rdquo; in our own gallery holds a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>history of a couple of antagonistic temperaments
united by life in common and the clasping hands
of children. Lotto does not keep the personal expression
out of even such a canvas as his &ldquo;Triumph
of Chastity&rdquo; in the Rospigliosi Gallery. His
delightful Venus, one of the loveliest nudes
in painting, flies from the attacking termagant,
whose virtue is proclaimed by the ermine on
her breast, and sweeps her little cupid with her
with a well-bred, surprised air, suggestive of the
manners of mundane society.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Lorenzo Lotto.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PORTRAIT OF LAURA DI POLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Brera.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p>The painter who was thus able to unveil
personality had evidently a mind that was aware
of itself, that looked forward to a wider civilisation
and a more earnest and intimate religion.
His life seems to have been one of some sadness,
and crowned with only moderate success. He
speaks of himself as &ldquo;advanced in years, without
loving care of any kind, and of a troubled mind.&rdquo;
His will shows that his worldly possessions were
few and poor, and that he had no heir closer
than a nephew; but he leaves some of his
cartoons as a dowry to &ldquo;two girls of quiet
nature, healthy in mind and body, and likely to
make thrifty housekeepers,&rdquo; on their marriage
to &ldquo;two well-recommended young men,&rdquo; about
to become painters. His sensitive and introspective
temperament led him to prefer the
retirement and the quiet beauty of Loreto to the
brilliant society of which he was made free in
Venice. &ldquo;His spirit,&rdquo; says Mr. Berenson, &ldquo;is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>more like our own than is perhaps that of any
other Italian painter, and it has all the appeal
and fascination of a kindred soul in another age.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>SEBASTIAN DEL PIOMBO</strong></p>


<p>It was very natural that Rome should wish for
works of the masters of the new Venetian School,
but the first-rate men were fully employed at
home. All the efforts made to secure Titian
failed till nearly the end of his career. On the
other hand, Venice was full of less famous
masters following in Giorgione&#8217;s steps. When
Sebastian Luciani was a young man, Giorgione
was paramount there, and no one could have
foretold that his life would be of such short
duration. It was to be expected, therefore, that
a painter who consulted his own interests should
leave the city where he was overshadowed by
a great genius and go farther afield. The
influence of the Guilds was withdrawn in the
sixteenth century, so that it was a simpler
matter for painters to transfer their talents,
and painting was beginning to appeal strongly
to the <em>dilettanti</em>, who rivalled one another in
their offers.</p>

<p>Only one work of Sebastian&#8217;s is known belonging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>to this earlier time in Venice. It is
the &ldquo;S. Chrysostom enthroned,&rdquo; in S. Giovanni
Crisostomo, and its majesty and rich colouring,
and more especially the splendid group of women
on the left, so proud and soft in their Venetian
beauty, make us wonder if Sebastian might not
have risen to greater heights if he had remained
in his natural environment. He responded to
the call to Rome of Agostino Chigi, the great
<ins class="translit" title="Chigi was a banker">painter</ins>, art collector, and patron, the friend of
Leo X. Chigi had just completed the Farnesina
Villa, and Sebastian was employed till
1512 on its decoration, and at once came under
the influence of Michelangelo. The &ldquo;Piet&agrave;&rdquo;
at Viterbo shows that influence very strongly; in
fact, Vasari says that Michelangelo himself drew
the cartoon for the figure of Christ, which would
account for its extraordinary beauty. Sebastian
embarked on a close intimacy with the Florentine
painter, and, according to Vasari, the great canvas
of the &ldquo;Raising of Lazarus,&rdquo; in the National
Gallery, was executed under the orders and in
part from the designs of Michelangelo. This
colossal work was looked on as one of the most
important creations of the sixteenth century, but
there is little to make us wish to change it for
the altarpiece of S. Crisostomo. The desire for
scientific drawing and the search after composition
have produced a laboured effect; the female
figures are cast in a masculine mould, and it lacks
both the severe beauty of the Tuscan School and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>the emotional charm of Sebastian&#8217;s native style.
We cannot, however, avoid conjecturing if in
the figure of Lazarus himself we have not a
conception of the great Florentine. It is so
easy in pose, so splendid in its, perhaps excessive,
length of limb, that our thoughts turn
involuntarily to the <em>Ignudi</em> in the Sixtine
Chapel. The picture has been dulled and
injured by repainting, but the distance still
has the sombre depth of the Venetians. All
through Sebastian&#8217;s career he seeks for form
and composition, but, great painter as he undoubtedly
is, he is great because he possesses
that inborn feeling for harmony of colour. This
is what we value in him, and he excels in so far
as he follows his Venetian instincts.</p>

<p>The death of Raphael improved Sebastian&#8217;s
position in Rome, and though Leo X. never
liked or employed him, he did not lack commissions.
The &ldquo;Fornarina&rdquo; in the Uffizi, with
the laurel-wreathed head and leopard-skin
mantle, still reveals him as the Venetian, and it is
curious that any critic should ever have assigned
its rich, voluptuous tone and its coarse type
to Raphael. Sebastian obtained commissions
for decorating S. Maria del Popolo in oils and
S. Pietro in Montorio in fresco, but in the
latter medium, though he is ambitious of acquiring
the force of Michelangelo, he lacks the
Tuscan ease of hand. Colour, for which he
possessed so true an aptitude, the deep, fused
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>colour of Giorgione, is set aside by him; his
tints become strong and crude, his surfaces grow
hard and polished, and he thinks, above all, of
bold action, of drawing and modelling. The
Venetian genius for portraiture remains, and he
has left such fine examples as the &ldquo;Andrea Doria&rdquo;
of the Vatican, or the &ldquo;Portrait of a Man in the
Pitti,&rdquo; a masterly picture both in drawing and
execution, with grand draperies, a fur pelisse,
and damask doublet with crimson sleeves. In
the National Gallery we possess his own portrait
by himself, in company with Cardinal de Medici.
The faces are well contrasted, and we judge from
Sebastian&#8217;s that his biographer describes him
justly, as fat, indolent, and given to self-indulgence,
but genial and fond of good company.</p>

<p>After an absence of twenty years he returned
to Venice. There he came in contact with
Titian and Pordenone, and struck up a friendship
with Aretino, who became his great ally and
admirer. The sack of Rome had driven him
forth, but in 1529, when the city was beginning
partially to recover from that time of horror,
he returned, and was cordially welcomed by
Clement VII., and admitted into the innermost
ecclesiastical circles. The Piombo, a well-paid,
sinecure office of the Papal court, was bestowed
on him, and his remaining years were spent in
Rome. He was very anxious to collaborate
with Michelangelo, and the great painter seems
to have been quite inclined to the arrangement.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>The &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo; in the Sixtine Chapel,
was suggested, and Sebastian had the melancholy
task of taking down Perugino&#8217;s masterpieces; but
he wished to reset the walls for oils, and Michelangelo
stipulated for fresco, saying that oils were
only fit for women, so that no agreement was
arrived at.</p>

<p>Sebastian&#8217;s mode of work was slow, and he
employed no assistants. He seems to have been
inordinately lazy, fond of leisure and good living,
and his character shows in his work, which, with
a few exceptions, has something heavy and
common about it, a want of keenness and fire,
an absence of refinement and selection.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BONIFAZIO AND PARIS BORDONE</strong></p>


<p>Some uncertainty has existed as to the identity
of the different members of the family of
Bonifazio. All the early historians agree in
giving the name to one master only. Boschini,
however, in 1777 discovered the register of the
death of a second, and a third bearing the name
was working twenty years later. Upon this
Dr. Morelli came to the conclusion that we must
recognise three, if not four, masters bearing the
name of Bonifazio, but documents recently
discovered by Professor Ludwig have in great
measure destroyed Morelli&#8217;s conjectures. There
may have been obscure painters bearing the name,
but they were mere imitators, and it is doubtful
if any were related to the family of de Pitatis.</p>

<p>Bonifazio Veronese is really the only one
who counts. As Ridolfi says, he was born in
Verona in the most beautiful moment of
painting. He came to Venice at the age of
eighteen, and became a pupil of Palma Vecchio,
with whom his work has sometimes been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>confused. After Palma&#8217;s death Bonifazio continued
in friendly relations with his old master&#8217;s
family, and his niece married Palma&#8217;s nephew.
Bonifazio himself married the daughter of a
basket-maker, and appears to have had no
children, for he and his wife by their wills
bestowed their whole fortune on their nephews.
Antonio Palma, who married Bonifazio&#8217;s niece,
was a painter whose pictures have sometimes
been attributed to the legendary third Bonifazio.
Bonifazio&#8217;s life was passed peacefully in Venice.
He received many important commissions from
the Republic, and decorated the Palace of the
Treasurers. His character and standing were
high, and he was appointed, in company with
Titian and Lotto, to administer a legacy which
Vincenzo Catena had left to provide a yearly
dower for five maidens. After a long life spent
in steady work, Bonifazio withdrew to a little
farm amidst orchards&mdash;fifteen acres of land in
all&mdash;at San Zenone, near Asolo; but he still kept
his house in San Marcuola, where he died. He
was buried in S. Alvise in Venice.</p>

<p>A son of the plains and of Venetian stock,
his work is always graceful and attractive,
though inclined to be hot in colour. It has a
very pronounced aristocratic character, and bears
no trace of the rough, provincial strain of
such men as Cariani or Pordenone. It is very
fine and glowing in colour, but lacks vigour
and energy in design. Nowhere do we get
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>more worldly magnificence or such frank
worship of wealth as on Bonifazio&#8217;s joyous
canvases. He represents Christian saints and
Eastern kings alike, as gentlemen of princely
rank. There is a note of purely secular art
about his Adorations and Holy Families. In
the &ldquo;Adoration of the Magi,&rdquo; in the Academy,
the Madonna is a handsome, prosperous lady
of Bonifazio&#8217;s acquaintance. The Child, so far
from raising His hand in benediction, holds it out
for the proffered cup. He does not, as usual,
distinguish the eldest king, but singles out the
cup held by the second, who, in a puffed
velvet dress, is an evident portrait, probably
that of the donor of the picture, who is in this
way paid a courtier-like compliment. The
third king is such a Moor as Bonifazio must
often have seen embarking from his Eastern
galley on the Riva dei Schiavoni. A servant
in a peaked hood peers round the column to
catch sight of what is going on. The groups
of animals in the background are well rendered.
In the &ldquo;Rich Man&#8217;s Feast,&rdquo; where Lazarus
lies upon the step, we have another scene of
wealthy and sumptuous Venetian society, an
orgy of colour. And, again, in the &ldquo;Finding of
Moses&rdquo; (Brera) he paints nobles playing the lute,
making love and feasting, and lovely fair-haired
women listening complacently. We are reminded
of the way in which they lived: their
one preoccupation the toilet, the delight of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>appearing in public in the latest and most
magnificent fashions. And in these paintings
Bonifazio depicts the elaborate striped and
brocaded gowns in which the beautiful Venetians
arrayed themselves, made in the very fashions
of the year, and their thick, fair hair is twisted
and coiled in the precise mode of the moment.
The deep-red velvet he introduces into nearly
all his pictures is of a hue peculiar to himself.
As Catena often brings in a little white lap-dog,
so Bonifazio constantly has as an accessory a liver-and-white
spaniel.</p>

<p>Vasari speaks of Paris Bordone as the artist
who most successfully imitated Titian. He was
the son of well-to-do tradespeople in Treviso,
and received a good education in music and
letters, before being sent off to Venice and
placed in Titian&#8217;s studio. Bordone does not
seem to have been on very friendly terms with
Titian. He was dissatisfied with his teaching,
and Titian played him an ill turn in wresting
from him a commission to paint an altarpiece
which had been entrusted to him when he was
only eighteen. He was, above all, in love with
the manner of the dead Giorgione, and it was
upon this master that he aspired to form his
style. His masterpiece, in the Academy, was
painted for the Confraternity of St. Mark, and
made his reputation. The legend it represents
may be given in a few words:</p>

<p>In the days of Doge Gradenigo, one February,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>there arose a fearful storm in Venice. During
the height of the tempest, three men accosted a
poor old fisherman, who was lying in his decayed
old boat by the Piazza, and begged that he
would row them to S. Niccolo del Lido, where
they had urgent business. After some demur
they persuaded him to take the oars, and in
spite of the hurricane, the voyage was accomplished.
On reaching the shore they pointed out
to him a great ship, the crew of which he perceived
to consist of a band of demons, who were
stirring up the waves and making a great
hubbub. The three passengers laid their commands
on them to desist, when immediately
they sailed away and there was a calm. The
passengers then made the oarsman row them,
one to S. Niccolo, one to S. Giorgio, and the
third was rowed back to the Piazza. The
fisherman timidly asked for his fare, and the
third passenger desired him to go to the Doge
and ask for payment, telling him that by that
night&#8217;s work a great disaster had been averted
from the city. The fisherman replied that he
should not be believed, but would be imprisoned
as a liar. Then the passenger drew a ring from
his finger. &ldquo;Show him this for a sign,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and know that one of those you have this night
rowed is S. Niccolas, the other is S. George, and
I am S. Mark the Evangelist, Protector of
the Venetian Republic.&rdquo; He then disappeared.
The next day the fisherman presented the ring,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>and was assigned a provision for life from the
Senate.</p>

<p>There has, perhaps, never been a richer and
more beautiful subject-picture painted than this
glowing canvas, or one which brings more vividly
before us the magnificence of the pageants which
made such a part of Venetian life in the golden age
of painting. It is all strength and splendour, and
escapes the hectic colour and weaker type which
appear in Bordone&#8217;s &ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo; and some of
his other works. In 1538 he went to France
and entered the service of Francis II., painting
for him many portraits of ladies, besides works
for the Cardinals of Guise and of Lorraine. The
King of Poland sent to him for a &ldquo;Jupiter and
Antiope.&rdquo; At Augsburg he was paid 3000 crowns
for work done for the great Fugger family.</p>

<p>No one gives us so closely as Bordone the type
of woman who at this time was most admired in
Venice. The Venetian ideal was golden haired,
with full lips, fair, rosy cheeks, large limbed and
ample, with &ldquo;abundant flanks and snow-white
breast.&rdquo; A type glowing with health and instinct
with life, but, to say the truth, rather dull, without
deep passions, and with no look that reveals
profound emotions or the struggle of a soul.
From what we see of Bordone&#8217;s female portraits
and from some of the mythological compositions
he has left, he might have been among the most
sensually minded of men. His beautiful courtesan,
in the National Gallery, is an almost over-realistic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>presentment of a woman who has just
parted from her lover. His women, with their
carnation cheeks and expressionless faces, are like
beautiful animals; but, as a matter of fact, their
painter was sober and temperate in his life, very
industrious, and devoted to his widowed mother.
About 1536 he married the daughter of a
Venetian citizen, and had a son, who became one
of the many insignificant painters of the end of the
sixteenth century. Most of his days were divided
between his little Villa of Lovadina in the district
of Belluno, and his modest home in the Corte
dell&#8217; Cavallo near the Misericordia. &ldquo;He lives
comfortably in his quiet house,&rdquo; writes Vasari,
who certainly knew Bordone in Venice, &ldquo;working
only at the request of princes, or his friends,
avoiding all rivalry and those vain ambitions
which do but disturb the repose of man, and
seeking to avert any ruffling of the serene
tranquillity of his life, which he is accustomed
to preserve simple and upright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of his pictures show an intense love
of country solitudes. His poetic backgrounds,
lonely mountains, leafy woods, and sparkling
water are in curious contrast to the sumptuous
groups in the foreground.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Three Heads,&rdquo; in the Brera, is a superb
piece of painting and an interesting characterisation.
The woman is ripe, sensual, and calculating,
feeling with her fingers for the gold chain,
a mere golden-fleshed, rose-flushed hireling, solid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>and prosaic. The go-between is dimly seen in
the background, but the face of the suitor is a
strange, ironic study: past youth, worn, joyless,
and bitter, taking his pleasure mechanically
and with cynical detachment. The &ldquo;Storm
calmed by S. Mark&rdquo; (Academy) was, in Mr.
Berenson&#8217;s opinion, begun by Giorgione.</p>

<p>Rich, brilliant, and essentially Venetian as is
the work of these two painters, it does not reach
the highest level. It falls short of grandeur, and
has that worldly tone that borders on vulgarity.
As we study it we feel that it marks the point
to which Venetian art might have attained, the
flood-mark it might have touched, if it had
lacked the advent of the three or four great
spirits, who, appearing about the same time, bore
it up to sublimer heights and developed a
more distinguished range of qualities. Bonifazio
and Bordone lack the grandeur and sweetness of
Titian, the brilliant touch and imaginative genius
of Tintoretto, the matchless feeling for colour,
design, and decoration of Veronese, but they
continue Venetian painting on logical lines, and
they form a superb foundation for the highest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>PAINTERS OF THE VENETIAN PROVINCES</strong></p>


<p>It has become usual to include in the Venetian
School those artists from the subject provinces
on the mainland, who came down to try their
luck at the fountain-head and to receive its hallmark
on their talent. The Friulan cities, Udine,
Serravalle, and small neighbouring towns, had
their own primitive schools and their scores of
humble craftsmen. Their art wavered for some
time in its expression between the German taste,
which came so close to their gates, and the Italian,
which was more truly their element.</p>

<p>Up to 1499 Friuli was invaded seven times
in thirty years by the Turks. They poured in
large numbers over the Bosnian borders, crossed
the Isonzo and the Tagliamenta, and massacred
and carried off the inhabitants. These terrible
periods are marked by the cessation of work in
the provinces, but hope always revived again.
The break caused by such a visitation can be
distinctly traced in the Church of S. Antonino,
at the little town of San Daniele. Martino da
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>Udine obtained the epithet of Pellegrino da San
Daniele in 1494 when he returned from an early
visit to Venice, where he had been apprenticed to
Cima. He was appointed to decorate S. Antonino.
His early work there is hard and coarse, ill-drawn,
the figures unwieldy and shapeless, and
the colour dusky and uniform; but owing to
the Turkish raid, he had to take flight, and it
was many a year before the monks gained
sufficient courage and saved enough money to
continue the embellishment of their church.
In the meantime, Pellegrino&#8217;s years had been
spent partly in Venice and partly, perhaps, in
Ferrara, for the reason Raphael gave for refusing
to paint a &ldquo;Bacchus&rdquo; for the Duke, was that the
subject had already been painted by Pellegrino
da San Daniele. When Pellegrino resumed his
work, it demonstrated that he had studied the
modern Venetians and had come under a finer,
deeper influence. A St. George in armour
suggests Giorgione&#8217;s S. Liberale at Castelfranco;
he specially shows an affinity with Pordenone,
who was his pupil and who was to become a
better painter than his old master. As Pellegrino
goes on he improves consistently, and adopts the
method, so peculiarly Venetian, of sacrificing form
to a scheme of chiaroscuro. He even, to some
extent, succeeds in his difficult task of applying
to wall painting the system which the Venetians
used almost exclusively for easel pictures. He
was an ambitious, daring painter, and some of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>his church standards were for long attributed to
Giorgione. The church of San Antonino remains
his chief monument; but for all his travels
Pellegrino remains provincial in type, is unlucky
in his selection, cares little for precision of form,
and trusts to colour for effect.</p>

<p>The same transition in art was taking place in
other provinces. Morto da Feltre, Pennacchi,
and Girolamo da Treviso have all left work of a
Giorgionesque type, and some painters who went
far onward, began their career under such minor
masters. Giovanni Antonio Licinio, who takes
his name from his native town of Pordenone, in
Friuli, was one of these. All the early part of
his life was spent in painting frescoes in the
small towns of the Friulan provinces. At first
they bear signs of the tuition of Pellegrino, but
it soon becomes evident that Pordenone has
learned to imitate Giorgione and Palma. Quite
early, however, one of his chief failings appears,
and one which is all his own, the disparity
in size between his various figures. The
secondary personages, the Magi in a Nativity,
the Saints standing round an altar, are larger
and more athletic in build and often more
animated in action than the principal actors in
the scene. What pleased Pordenone&#8217;s contemporaries
was his daring perspective and his
instinctive feeling for movement. He carried
out great schemes in the hill-towns, till at
length his reputation, which had long been ripe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>in his native province, reached Venice. In 1519
he was invited to Treviso to fresco the fa&ccedil;ade of
a house for one of the Raviguino family. The
painter, as payment, asked fifty scudi, and Titian
was called in to adjudicate, but he admired the
work so much that he hinted to Raviguino that
he would be wise not to press him for a valuation.
As a direct consequence of this piece of
business, Pordenone was employed on the chapel
at Treviso, in conjunction with Titian. At this
time the Assumption and the Madonna of Casa
Pesaro were just finished, and it is probable
that Pordenone paid his first visit to Venice,
hard by, and saw his great contemporary&#8217;s work.
With his characteristic distaste for fresco,
Titian undertook the altarpiece and painted the
beautiful Annunciation which still holds its
place, and Pordenone covered the dome with
a foreshortened figure of the Eternal Father,
surrounded by angels. Among the remaining
frescoes in the Chapel, an Adoration of the
Magi and a S. Liberale are from his brush.
Fired by his success at Treviso, Pordenone offered
his services to Mantua and Cremona, but the
Mantovans, accustomed to the stately and restrained
grace of Mantegna, would have nothing to say
to what Crowe and Cavalcaselle call his &ldquo;large
and colossal fable-painting.&rdquo; He pursued his way
to Cremona, and that he studied Mantegna as he
passed through Mantua is evident from the first
figures he painted in the cathedral. In Cremona
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>every one admired him, and all the artists set to
work to imitate his energetic foreshortening,
vehement movement and huge proportions.</p>

<p>Pordenone, with his love for fresco, was all
his life an itinerant painter. In 1521 he was
back at Udine and wandered from place to place,
painting a vast distemper for the organ doors at
S. Maria at Spilimbergo, the fa&ccedil;ade of the Church
of Valeriano, an imposing series at Travesio, and
in 1525, the &ldquo;Story of the True Cross&rdquo; at Casara.
At the last place he threw aside much of his
exaggeration, and, ruined and restored as the
frescoes are, they remain among his most
dignified achievements. He may be studied
best of all at Piacenza, in the Church of the
Madonna di Campagna, where he divides his
subjects between sacred and pagan, so that we
turn from a &ldquo;Flight into Egypt&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Marriage
of S. Catherine,&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Rape of Europa&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Venus and Adonis.&rdquo; At Piacenza he shows
himself the great painter he undoubtedly is,
having achieved some mastery over form, while
his colour has the true Venetian quality and almost
equals oils in its luscious tones and vivid hues,
which he lowers and enriches by such enveloping
shadows as only one whose spirit was in touch
with the art of Giorgione would have understood
how to use. Very complete records remain of
Pordenone&#8217;s life, full details of a quarrel with his
brother over property left by his father in 1533,
and accounts of the painter&#8217;s negotiations to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>obtain a knighthood, which he fancied would
place him more on a par with Titian when he
went to live in Venice. The coveted honour
was secured, but from this time he seems to have
been very jealous of Titian and to have aimed
continually at rivalling him. Pordenone was a
punctual and rapid decorator, and on being given
the ceiling of the Sala di San Finio to decorate
in the summer of 1536, he finished the whole
by March 1538. We have seen how Titian
annoyed the Signoria by his delays, how anxious
they were to transfer his commission to
Pordenone, and what a narrow escape the
Venetian had of losing his Broker&#8217;s patent.
Pordenone was engaged by the nuns of Murano
to paint an Annunciation, after they had rejected
one by Titian on account of its price, and though
it seems hardly possible that any one could have
compared the two men, yet no doubt the pleasure
of getting an altarpiece quickly and punctually
and for a moderate sum, often outweighed the
honour of the possible painting by the great
Titian.</p>

<p>No one has left so few easel-paintings as
Pordenone; fresco was so much better suited to
his particular style. The canvas of the &ldquo;Madonna
of Mercy&rdquo; in the Venice Academy, was painted
about 1525 for a member of the house of
Ottobono, and introduces seven members of the
family. It is very free from his colossal,
exaggerated manner; the attendant saints are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>studied from nature, and in his journals the
painter mentions that the St. Roch is a portrait
of himself. The &ldquo;S. Lorenzo enthroned,&rdquo; in
the same gallery, shows both his virtues and
failings. The saints have his enormous proportions.
The Baptist is twisting round, to
display the foreshortening which Pordenone
particularly affects. The gestures are empty
and inexpressive, but the colour is broad and
fluid; there is a large sense of decoration in the
composition, and something simple and austere
about the figure of S. Lorenzo. As is so often
the case with Pordenone, the principal actor of
the scene is smaller and more sincerely imagined
than the attendant personages, who are crowded
into the foreground, where they are used to
display the master&#8217;s skill.</p>

<p>Pordenone died suddenly at Ferrara, where he
had been summoned by its Duke to undertake
one of his great schemes of decoration. He was
said to have been poisoned, but though he had
jealous rivals there seems no proof of the truth
of the assertion, which was one very commonly
made in those days. He is interesting as being
the only distinguished member of the Venetian
School whose frescoes have come down to us in
any number, and as being the only one of the
later masters with whom it was the chosen
medium.</p>

<p>His kinsman, Bernardino Licinio, is represented
in the National Gallery by a half-length
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>of a young man in black, and at Hampton Court
by a large family group and by another of three
persons gathered round a spinet. His masterpiece
is a Madonna and Saints in the Frari,
which shows the influence of Palma. His flesh
tints, striving to be rich, have a hot, red look,
but his works have been constantly confounded
with those of Giorgione and Paris Bordone.</p>

<p>A long list might be given of minor artists
who were industriously turning out work on
similar lines to one or other of these masters:
Calderari, who imitates Paris Bordone as well as
Pordenone; Pomponio Amalteo, Pordenone&#8217;s son-in-law,
a spirited painter in fresco; Florigerio,
who practised at Udine and Padua, and of whom
an altarpiece remains in the Academy; Giovanni
Battista Grassi, who helped Vasari to compile
his notices of Friulan art, and many others only
known by name.</p>

<p>At the close of the fifteenth century the
revulsion against Paduan art extended as far
as Brescia, and Girolamo Romanino was one
of the first to acquire the trick of Venetian
painting. He probably studied for a time under
Friulan painters. Pellegrino is thought to have
been at Brescia or Bergamo during the Friulan
disturbances of 1506-12, and about 1510
Romanino emerges, a skilled artist in Pellegrino&#8217;s
Palmesque manner. His works at this
time are dark and glowing, full of warm light
and deep shadow; the scene is often laid under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>arches, after the manner of the Vivarini and
Cima; a gorgeous scheme of accessory is framed
in noble architecture.</p>

<p>Brescia was an opulent city, second only to
Milan among the towns of northern Italy, and
Romanino obtained plenty of patronage; but in
1511 the city fell a prey to the horrors of war,
was taken and lost by Venice, and in 1512 was
sacked by the French. Romanino fled to Padua,
where he found a home among the Benedictines
of S. Giustina. Here he was soon well employed
on an altarpiece with life-size figures for the
high altar, and a &ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo; for the
refectory. It is also surmised that he helped
in the series for the Scuola del Santo, for several
of which Titian in 1511 had signed a receipt,
and the &ldquo;Death of St. Anthony&rdquo; is pointed out
as showing the Brescian characteristics of fine
colour, but poor drawing.</p>

<p>Romanino returned to Brescia when the
Venetians recovered it in 1516, but before doing
so he went to Cremona and painted four subjects,
which are among his most effective, in the choir
of the Duomo.</p>

<p>He is not so daring a painter as Pordenone,
from whom he sometimes borrows ideas, but
he is quite a convert to the modern style
of the day, setting his groups in large spaces
and using the slashed doublets, the long hose,
and plumed headgear which Giorgione had
found so picturesque. Romanino is often very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>poor and empty, and fails most in selection and
expression at the moments when he most needs
to be great, but he is successful in the golden
style he adopted after his closer contact with the
Venetians, and his draperies and flesh tints are
extremely brilliant. He is, indeed, inclined to
be gaudy and careless in execution, and even the
fine &ldquo;Nativity&rdquo; in the National Gallery gives
the impression that size is more regarded than
thought and feeling.</p>

<p>Moretto is perhaps the only painter from the
mainland who, coming within the charmed circle
of Venetian art and betraying the study of Palma
and Titian and the influence of Pordenone, still
keeps his own gamut of colour, and as he goes
on, gets consistently cooler and more silvery in
his tones. He can only be fully studied in
Brescia itself, where literally dozens of altarpieces
and wall-paintings show him in every
phase. His first connection was probably with
Romanino, but he reminds us at one time of
Titian by his serious realism, and finished, careful
painting, at another of Raphael, by the grace
and sentiment of his heads, and as time goes on
he foreshadows the style of Veronese. In the
&ldquo;Feast in the House of Simon&rdquo; in the organ-loft
of the Church of the Piet&agrave; in Venice, the
very name prepares us for the airy, colonnaded
building, with vistas of blue sky and landscape,
and the costly raiment and plenishing which
might have been seen at any Venetian or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>Brescian banquet. In his portraits Moretto
sometimes rivals Lotto. His personages are
always dignified and expressive, with pale,
high-bred faces, and exceedingly picturesque
in dress and general arrangement. He loved
to paint a great gentleman, like the Sciarra
Martinengo in the National Gallery, and to
endow him with an air of romantic interest.</p>

<p>One of those who entered so closely into the
spirit of the Venetian School that he may almost
be included within it, is Savoldo. His pictures
are rare, and no gallery can show more than one
or two examples. The Louvre has a portrait
by him of Gaston de Foix, long thought to be
by Giorgione. His native town can only show
one altarpiece, an &ldquo;Adoration of Shepherds,&rdquo;
low in tone but intense in dusky shadow with
fringes of light. He is grey and slaty in his
shadows, and often rough and startling in effect,
but at his best he produces very beautiful, rich,
evening harmonies; and a letter from Aretino
bears witness to the estimation in which he was
held.</p>

<p>It is not easy to say if Brescia or Vicenza has
most claim to Bartolommeo Montagna, the early
master of Cima. Born of Brescian parents, he
settled early in Vicenza, and he is by far the most
distinguished of those Vicentine painters who
drank at the Venetian fount. He must have
gone early to Venice and worked with the
Vivarini, for in his altarpiece in the Brera he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>has the vaulted porticoes in which Bartolommeo
and Alvise Vivarini delighted. His &ldquo;Madonna
enthroned&rdquo; in the gallery at Vicenza has many
points of contact with that of Alvise at Berlin.
Among these are the four saints, the cupola, and
the raised throne, and he is specially attracted
by the groups of music-making angels; but
Montagna has more moral greatness than Alvise,
and his lines are stronger and more sinewy. He
keeps faithful to the Alvisian feeling for calm
and sweetness, but his personages have greater
weight and gravity. He essays, too, a &ldquo;Piet&agrave;&rdquo;
with saints, at Monte Berico, and shows both
pathos and vehemence. He has evidently seen
Bellini&#8217;s rendering, and attempts, if only with
partial success, to contrast in the same way the
indifference of death with the contemplation
and anguish of the bereaved. Hard and angular
as Montagna&#8217;s saints often are, they show
power and austerity. His colour is brilliant
and enamel-like; he does not arrive at the
Venetian depth, yet his altarpieces are very
grand, and once more we are struck by the
greatness of even the secondary painters who
drew their inspiration from Padua and Venice.</p>

<p>Among the other Vicentines, Giovanni Speranza
and Giovanni Buonconsiglio were imbued
with characteristics of Mantegna. Speranza,
in one of his few remaining works, almost
reproduces the beautiful &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo; by
Pizzolo, Mantegna&#8217;s young fellow-student, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>the Chapel of the Eremitani. He employs
Buonconsiglio as an assistant, and they imitate
Montagna to such an extent that it is difficult to
distinguish between their works. Buonconsiglio&#8217;s
&ldquo;Piet&agrave;&rdquo; in the Vicenza gallery, is reminiscent
of Montagna&#8217;s at Monte Berico. The types are
lean and bony, the features are almost as rugged
as D&uuml;rer&#8217;s, the flesh earthy and greenish. About
1497 Buonconsiglio was studying oils with
Antonello da Messina; he begins to reside in
Venice, and a change comes over his manner.
His colours show a brilliancy and depth acquired
by studying Titian; and then, again, his bright
tints remind us of Lotto. His name was on the
register of the Venetian Guild as late as 1530.</p>

<p>After Pisanello&#8217;s achievement and his marked
effect on early Venetian art, Veronese painting
fell for a time to a very low ebb; but Mantegna&#8217;s
influence was strongly felt here, and art revived
in Liberale da Verona, Falconetto, Casoto,
the Morone and Girolamo dai Libri, painters
delightful in themselves, but having little connection
with the school of Venice. Francesco
Bonsignori, however, shook himself free from
the narrow circle of Veronese art, where he had
for a time followed Liberale, and grows more
like the Vicentines, Montagna and Buonconsiglio.
He is careful about his drawing, but his figures,
like those of many of these provincial painters, are
short, bony and vulgar, very unlike the slender,
distinguished type of the great Paduan. Under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>the name of Francesco da Verona, Bonsignori
works in the new palace of the Gonzagas, and
several pictures painted for Mantua are now
scattered in different collections. At Verona he
has left four fine altarpieces. He went early
to Venice, where he became the pupil of the
Vivarini. His faces grow soft and oval, and
the very careful outlines suggest the influence
of Bellini.</p>

<p>Girolamo Mocetto was journeyman to Giovanni
Bellini; in fact, Vasari says that a &ldquo;Dead
Christ&rdquo; in S. Francesco della Vigna, signed
with Bellini&#8217;s name, is from Mocetto&#8217;s hand.
His short, broad figures have something of
Bartolommeo Vivarini&#8217;s character.</p>

<p>Francesco Torbido went to Venice to study
with Giorgione, and we can trace his master&#8217;s
manner of turning half tones into deep shades;
but he does not really understand the Giorgionesque
treatment, in which shade was always rich
and deep, but never dark, dirty and impenetrable,
nor in the lights can he produce the clear glow
of Giorgione. Another Veronese, Cavazzola, has
left a masterpiece upon which any painter might
be happy to rest his reputation; the &ldquo;Gattemalata
with an Esquire&rdquo; in the Uffizi, a picture noble
in feeling and in execution, and one which owes
a great deal to Venetian portrait-painters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>PAOLO VERONESE</strong></p>


<p>Paolo Veronese, though perhaps he is not to
be placed on the very highest pinnacle of the
Venetian School, must be classed among those
few great painters who rose far above the level
of most of his contemporaries and who brought
in a special note and flavour of his own. His
art is an independent art, and he borrows little
from predecessors or contemporaries. His free
and joyous temperament gave relief at a moment
when the Venetian scheme of colour threatened
to become too sombre, and when Sebastian del
Piombo, Pordenone, Titian himself, and above all
Tintoretto, were pushing chiaroscuro to extremes.
Veronese discards the deepest bronzes and mulberries
and crimsons and oranges, and finds his
range among cream and rose and grey-greens.
Titian concentrated his colours and intensified
his lights, Tintoretto sacrifices colour to vivid
play of light and dark, but Veronese avoids the
dark; the generous light plays all through his
scenes. He has no wish to secure strong effects
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>but delights in soft, faded tints; old rose and
<em>turquoise morte</em>. In his colour and his subjects
he is a personification of the robust, proud, joy-loving
Republic, in which, as M. Yriarte says,
a man produced his works as a tree produces its
fruit. We get very near him in those vast
palaces and churches and villas, where his heroic
figures expand in the azure air, against the white
clouds, and yet he is one of the artists of the
Renaissance about whom we know least. Here
and there, in contemporary biography, we come
across a mention of him and learn that he was
sociable and lively, quick at taking offence, fond
of his family and anxious to do his best by them.
He was, too, very generous with his work&mdash;a
great contrast in this respect to Titian&mdash;and
contracts with convents and confraternities show
that he often only stipulated for payment for
bare time. Yet he was fond of personal luxury,
loved rich stuffs, horses and hounds, and, says
Ridolfi, &ldquo;always wore velvet breeches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His first masters, according to Mr. Berenson,
were Badile and Brusasorci, masters of Verona,
but before he was twenty, he was away working
on his own account. His first patron was
Cardinal Gonzaga, who brought several painters
from Verona to Mantua; but Mantua was no
longer what it had been in the days of Isabela
d&#8217;Este, and Paolo Caliari soon returned to his
own town. Before he was twenty-three he had
decorated Villa Porti, near Vicenza, in collaboration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>with Zelotti, a Veronese, portraying feasting
gods and goddesses, framed in light architectural
designs in monochrome. The two painters went
on to other villas, mixing mortal and mythical
figures in a happy, light-hearted medley.</p>

<p>Zelotti having received a commission at
Vicenza, Paolo decided to seek his fortune in
Venice. The Prior of the Convent of San Sebastiano,
on the Zattere, was a Veronese, and Caliari
wrote to him before arriving in Venice in 1555.
Thanks to the good Prior, who played a considerable
part in his destiny, he obtained a
commission for a &ldquo;Coronation of the Virgin
and four other Saints.&rdquo; He first painted the
sacristy, but his success was instantaneous, and
many orders followed. The ceiling of the
church was devoted to the history of Esther.
The whole of these paintings are marvellously
well preserved, and, inset in the carved and gilt
framework, make a <em>coup d&#8217;&oelig;il</em> of surprising
beauty. They had an immense effect. Every
one was able to appreciate these joyous pictures
of Venice, the loveliness of her skies, the pomp
of her ceremonies, the rich Eastern stuffs and the
glorious architecture of her palaces. It was an
auspicious moment for a painter of Veronese&#8217;s
temper; the so-called Republic, now, more than
ever, an oligarchy, was at the height of its fortunes,
redecorating was going forward everywhere,
the merchant-nobility was rich and spending
magnificently, the Eastern trade was flourishing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>Venice was in all her glory. The patrons Caliari
came to work for, preferred the ceremonial to
the imaginative treatment of sacred themes, and
he does not choose the tragedies of the Bible
for illustration. He paints the history of Esther,
with its royal audiences, banquets, and marriage-feasts.
His Christs and Maries and Martyrs are
composed, courtly personages, who maintain a
dignified calm under misfortune, and have very
little violent feeling to show.</p>

<p>At the time of his arrival in Venice, Palma
Vecchio was just dead, Tintoretto was absorbed
by the Scuola di San Rocco, Paris Bordone was
with Francis I. As rivals, Caliari had Salviati,
Bonifazio, Schiavone, and Zelotti, all rendering
homage to Titian who was eighty years old,
but still in full vigour. Titian&#8217;s opinions in
matters of art were dictates, his judgment was
a law. He immediately recognised Veronese&#8217;s
genius, which was of a kind to appeal to him,
and together with Sansovino, who at this
time was Director of Buildings to the Signoria,
he received the young painter with an approval
which ensured him a good start. Five years
after Veronese&#8217;s arrival he was retained to
decorate the Villa Barbaro at Maser, which is
a type of those patrician country-houses to which
the Venetians were becoming more attached
every year. Daniele Barbaro, Patriarch of
Aquileia, whose magnificent portrait by Veronese
is in the Pitti, was himself an artist and designed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>the ceiling of the Hall of the Council of Ten.
Palladio, Alessandro Vittoria, and Veronese were
associated to build him a dwelling worthy of a
Prince of the Church. In style the villa is a total
contrast to the gorgeous Venetian palaces; it is
sober and simple, and well adapted to leisure and
retirement. Its white stucco walls and decorations
are devoid of gilding and colour, and the
rooms adorned by Veronese&#8217;s brush show him
in quite a new light. His visit to Rome did
not take place till four years later, but he
has been influenced here by the feeling for
the antique, and he thinks much of line and
style. He leaves on one side the gorgeous
brocades and gleaming satins, in which he usually
delights, and his nymphs are only clothed in
their own beauty. And here Veronese shows
his admirable taste and discretion; his patrons,
the Barbaro family, are his friends, men and
women of the world, who put no restraint on his
fancy, and are not prone to censure, and Veronese,
with the bridle on his neck, so to speak, uses his
opportunities fully, yet never exceeds the limits
of good taste. He is not gross and sensual like
Rubens, but proud, grave and sweet, seductive,
but never suggestive or vulgar. After having
placed single figures wherever he can find a nook,
he assembles all the gods of Olympia at a supper
in the cupola. Immortality is a beautiful young
woman seated on a cloud. Mercury gazes at
her, caduceus in hand; Diana caresses her great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>hound; Saturn, an old man, rests his head on his
hand; Mars, Apollo, Venus, and a little cupid
are scattered in the Empyrean, and Jupiter
presides over the party. Below, a balcony rail
runs round the cupola, and looking over it, an
old lady, dressed in the latest fashion, points out
the company to a beautiful young one and to a
young man in a doublet who holds a hound in
a leash. They are evidently family portraits,
taken from those who looked on at the artist, and
on the other side he has introduced members of
his own family who were helping him. These
decorations have a gaiety, an absence of pedantry,
a sound and sane sympathy with the spirit of the
Renaissance which tell of a happy moment
when art was at its height and in touch with
its environment. From about 1563 we may
begin to date his great supper pictures. The
Marriage of Cana (Louvre), one of his most
famous works, was painted for the refectory in
Sammichele, the old part of S. Giorgio Maggiore.
The treaty for it is still in existence, dated June
1562. The artist asks for a year; the Prior is
to furnish canvas and colours, the painter&#8217;s board,
and a cask of wine. The further payment of 972
ducats illustrates the prices received by the
greatest artists at the height of the Renaissance:
&pound;280 for work which occupied quite eight months.</p>

<p>Veronese must have delighted in painting this
work. Needless to say, it is not in the least
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>religious. He has united in it all the most varied
personages who struck his imagination. So we
see a Spanish grandee, Francis I., Suleiman the
Sultan, Charles V., Vittoria Colonna, and
Eleanor of Austria. In the foreground, grouped
round a table, are Veronese himself, playing the
viol, Tintoretto accompanying him, Jacopo da
Ponte seated by them, and Paolo&#8217;s brother, the
architect, with his hand on his hip, tossing off a
full glass; and in the governor of the feast,
opulent and gorgeously attired, we recognise
Aretino. Under the marble columns of a
Grimani or a Pesaro, he brings in all the
illustrious actors of his own time and leaves us
an odd and informing document. We can but
accept the scene and admire the originality of its
design and the freedom of its execution, its boldness
and fancy, the way in which the varied
incidents are brought into harmony, and the
grace of the colonnade, peopled with spectators,
standing out against the depth of distant sky.</p>

<p>The celebrated suppers, of which this is the
first example, are dispersed in different galleries
and some have disappeared, but from this time
Veronese loved to paint these great displays,
repeating some of them, but always introducing
variety.</p>

(<em>Photo, Mansell and Co.</em>)</p>

<p>In 1564 he accompanied Girolamo Grimani,
procurator of St. Mark&#8217;s, who was appointed
ambassador to the Holy See, and for the first time
saw the works of Raphael and Michelangelo and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>the treasures of antiquity. For a time, the sight
of the antique had some effect upon his work;
in his famous ceiling in the Louvre, &ldquo;Jupiter
destroying the Vices,&rdquo; the influence of Michelangelo
is apparent and its large gestures are inspired
by sculpture. Ridolfi says that Veronese
brought home casts from Rome, and statues
of Amazons and the Laocoon seem to have
inspired the Jupiter. He did not go on long in
this path; he does not really care for the nude&mdash;it
is too simple for him. He prefers that his
saints and divinities should appear in the gorgeous
costumes of the day, and that his Venus
and Diana and the nymphs should trail in rich
brocades. But few documents are left concerning
his work for the Ducal Palace up to 1576;
much of it was destroyed in the great fire, but
the Signoria then gave him a number of fresh
commissions. The most important was the
immense oval of the &ldquo;Triumph of Venice,&rdquo;
or, as it is sometimes called, the &ldquo;Thanksgiving
for Lepanto&rdquo;; the Republic crowned by
victory and surrounded by allegorical figures,
Glory, Peace, Happiness, Ceres, Juno and the
rest. The composition shows the utmost freedom:
the fair Queen leans back, surrounded
by laughing patricians, who look up from their
balconies, as if they were attending a regatta on
the Grand Canal. The horses of the Free Companions,
the soldiers who go afar to carry out
the will of the Republic, prance in a crowd of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>personages, each of whom represents a town or
colony of her domain. Like all Veronese&#8217;s
creations, this will always be pre-eminently a
picture of the sixteenth century, dated by a
thousand details of costume, architecture, and
armour. Venice, the Venice of Lepanto and the
Venier, of Titian, Aretino, and Veronese himself,
makes a deep impression upon us, and the artist
reflects his age with sympathetic spontaneity.</p>

<p>Hardly a hall of the Ducal Palace but can
show a canvas of Veronese or the assistants by
whom he was now surrounded. From time to
time he resumed the decorations of S. Sebastiano,
and his incessant production betrays no trace
of fatigue or languor. The martyrdom of the
saint is a triumph of the beauty of the silhouette
against a radiant sky. He goes back to Verona
and paints the &ldquo;Martyrdom of St. George.&rdquo; He
pours light into it. The saints open a shining
path, down which a flower-crowned Love flutters
with the diadem and palm of victory. The
whole air and expression of St. George is full
of strength and that look of goodness and
serenity which is the painter&#8217;s nearest approach
to religious feeling. Veronese was created a
Chevalier of St. Mark; every one was asking for
his services, but he was a stay-at-home by nature
and fond of living with his family. Philip II.
longed to get him to cover his great walls in the
Escurial, but he very civilly declined all his invitations
and sent Federigo Zucchero in his stead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p><p>It was on account of the &ldquo;Feast in the House
of Levi&rdquo; that in 1573 he was hauled before the
tribunal of the Inquisition, and the document
concerning this was only discovered a few years
ago. The Signoria had never allowed any
tribunal to chastise works of literature; on
the contrary, Venice, though comparatively poor
herself in geniuses of the mind, was the refuge
of freedom of thought, and, in fact, had made a
sort of compact with Niccolas V., which allowed
her to set aside or suspend the decisions of the
Holy Office, from which she could not quite
emancipate herself. Veronese, however, was
denounced by some &ldquo;aggrieved person,&rdquo; to whom
his way of treating sacred subjects seemed an
outrage on religion. The members of the
tribunal demanded &ldquo;who the boy was with the
bleeding nose?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why were halberdiers
admitted?&rdquo; Veronese replied that they were the
sort of servants a rich and magnificent host would
have about him. He was then asked why he
had introduced the buffoon with a parrot on his
hand. He replied that he really thought only
Christ and His Apostles were present, but that
when he had a little space over, he adorned it
with imaginary figures. This defence of the vast
and crowded canvas did not commend itself, and
he was asked if he really thought that at the
Last Supper of our Saviour it was fitting to bring
in dwarfs, buffoons, drunken Germans, and other
absurdities. Did he not know that in Germany
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>and other places infested with heresy, they were
in the habit of turning the things of Holy Church
into ridicule, with intent to teach false doctrine
to the ignorant? Paolo for his defence cited the
Last Judgment, where Michelangelo had painted
every figure in the nude, but the Inquisitor
replied crushingly, that these were disembodied
spirits, who could not be expected to wear clothing.
Could Veronese uphold his picture as
decent? The painter was probably not very
much alarmed. He was a person of great importance
in Venice, and the proceedings of the
Inquisition were always jealously watched by
members of the Senate, who would not have permitted
any unfair interference with the liberties
of those under the protection of the State. The
real offence was the introduction of the German
soldiers, who were peculiarly obnoxious to the
Venetians; but Veronese did not care what the
subject was as long as it gave him an excuse for
a great <em>spectacle</em>. Brought to bay, he gave the
true answer: &ldquo;My Lords, I have not considered
all this. I was far from wishing to picture anything
disorderly. I painted the picture as it
seemed best to me and as my intellect could
conceive of it.&rdquo; It meant that Veronese painted
in the way that he considered most artistic, without
even remembering questions of religion, and
in this he summed up his whole &aelig;sthetic creed.
He was set at liberty on condition that he took
out one or two of the most offending figures.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>The &ldquo;Feast in the House of Levi&rdquo; (as he named
it after the trial) is the finest of all his great
scenic effects. The air circulates freely through
the white architecture, we breathe more deeply
as we look out into the wide blue sky, and
such is the sensation of expansion, that it is
hardly possible to believe we are gazing at a
flat wall. Titian&#8217;s backgrounds are a blue
horizon, a burning twilight. Veronese builds
marble palaces, with rosy shadows, or columns
blanched in the liquid light. His personages
show little violent action. He places them in
noble poses in which they can best show off
their magnificent clothes, and he endows his
patricians, his goddesses, his sacred persons, with
a uniform air of majestic indolence.</p>

<p>After his &ldquo;trial,&rdquo; Veronese proceeded more
triumphantly than ever. Every prince wished
to have something from his brush; the Emperor
Rudolph, at Prague, showed with pride the
canvases taken later by Gustavus Adolphus. The
Duke of Modena, carrying on the traditions of
Ferrara, added Veronese&#8217;s works to the treasures
of the house of Este. The last ten years of his
life were given up to visiting churches on the
mainland and on the little islands round Venice,
all covetous to possess something by the brilliant
Veronese, whose name was in every mouth. Torcello,
Murano, Treviso, Castelfranco, every convent
and monastery loaded him with commissions, and
it is significant of the spirit of the time, that in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>spite of the disapproval of the Holy See, his
most ardent patrons, those who delighted most
in his robust, uncompromising worldliness, were
to be found in the religious houses. Then, when
he went to rest in the summer heats in some villa
on the Brenta, he left delightful souvenirs here
and there. It was on such an occasion, for the
Pisani, that he painted the &ldquo;Family of Darius,&rdquo;
which was sold to England by a member of
the house in 1857. The royal captives, who
are throwing themselves at the feet of the
conqueror, are, with Paolo&#8217;s usual frank na&iuml;vet&eacute;
and disregard of anachronisms, dressed in full
Venetian costume&mdash;all the chief personages are
portraits of the Pisani family. The freedom
and rapidity of execution, the completeness and
finish, the charm of colour, the beauty of the
figures (especially the princely ones of Alexander
and Hephaestion), and its extraordinary energy,
make this one of the finest of all his works.
The critic, Charles Blanc, says of it,
&ldquo;It is absurd and dazzling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Rape of Europa,&rdquo; he recurred again
to one of those legends of fabled beings who have
outlasted dynasties and are still fresh and living.
Veronese was surrounded by men like Aretino
and Bembo, well versed in mythology, and with
his usual zest he makes the tale an excuse for
painting lovely, blooming women, rich toilets,
and a delightful landscape. The wild flowers
spring, and the little Loves fly to and fro against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>a cloud-flecked sky of the wonderful Veronese
turquoise. It is the work of a man who is a
true poet of colour and for whom colour represents
all the emotions of joy and pleasure.</p>

<p>Veronese died comparatively young, of chill
and fever, and all his family survived him. He
lies buried in San Sebastiano. From contemporary
memoirs we know that he lived and dressed
splendidly. He kept immense stores of gorgeous
stuffs to paint from in his studio, and drew
everything from life,&mdash;the negroes covered with
jewels, the bright-eyed pages, the models who,
robed in velvets, brocades and satins, became
queens or courtesans or saints. The pearls
which bedecked them were from his own
caskets. Though we know little of his private
life, his work is so alive that he seems personified
in it. He is saved from what might have been
a prosaic or a sordid style by the delicious, ever-changing
colour in which he revels; his silks
and satins are less modelled by shadows than
tinted by broken reflections, his embroidered and
striped and arabesqued tissues are so harmoniously
combined that the eye rests, wherever it falls, on
something exquisite and subtle in tint. This is
where his genius lies, &ldquo;the decoration does not
add to the interest of the drama; it replaces
it&rdquo;; in short, it <em>is</em> the drama itself, for his types
show little selection, and his ideal of female
beauty is not a very sympathetic one. His
personages are cold and devoid of expression,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>their gestures are rather meaningless, but by
means of light and air and exquisite colour he
gives the poetical touch which all great art
demands.</p>

<p>On account of their size few examples of
Veronese&#8217;s work are to be found in private
collections, but the galleries of the different
European capitals are rich in them. Numbers
of paintings, too, which are by his assistants
are dignified by his name, and directly after his
death spurious works were freely manufactured
and sold as genuine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>TINTORETTO</strong></p>


<p>It does not seem likely that many new discoveries
will be made about Tintoretto&#8217;s life. It
was an open and above-board one, and there is
practically no time during its span that we are
not able to account for, and to say where he
was living and how he was occupied. The son of
a dyer, a member of one of the powerful guilds
of Venice, the &ldquo;little dyer,&rdquo; <em>il tentoretto</em>, appears
as an enthusiastic boy, keen to learn his chosen
art. He was apprenticed to Titian and, immediately
after, summarily ejected from that
master&#8217;s workshop, on account, it seems probable,
of the independence and innovation of his style,
which was of the very kind most likely to shock
and puzzle Titian&#8217;s courtly, settled genius. After
this he painted when and where he could,
pursuing his artistic studies with the headlong
ardour which through life characterised his
attitude towards art. Mr. Berenson thinks he
may have worked in Bonifazio&#8217;s studio. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
formed a close friendship with Andrea Schiavone,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
he imported casts of Michelangelo&#8217;s statues, he
studied the works of Titian and Palma. Over
his door was written &ldquo;the colour of Titian and
the form of Michelangelo.&rdquo; All his energies
were for long devoted to the effort to master
that form. Colour came to him naturally, but
good drawing meant more to him than it had
ever done to any Venetian. Long afterwards, to
repeated inquiries as to how excellence could
be best ensured, he would give no other advice
than the reiterated, &ldquo;study drawing.&rdquo; He
practised till the human form in every attitude
held no difficulties for him. He suspended
little models by strings, and drew every limb
and torso he could get hold of over and over
again. He was found in every place where
painting was wanted, getting the builders to let
him experiment upon the house-fronts. To
master light and shade he constructed little
cardboard houses, in which, by means of sliding
shutters, lamplight and skylight effects could be
arranged. It is particularly interesting to hear of
this part of his education, as in the end the love
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>of shine and shadow was the most victorious of
all his inspirations.</p>

<p>The chief events in Tintoretto&#8217;s life are art-events.
For some years he frescoed the outside
of houses at a nominal price, or merely for his
expenses. He decorated household furniture and
everything he could lay hands on. Then came
a few small commissions, an altarpiece here,
organ-doors there, for unimportant churches.
No one in Venice talked of any one save Palma,
Bonifazio, and, above all, Titian, and it was difficult
enough for an outsider, who was not one of their
clique, to get employment. But by the time
Tintoretto was twenty-six his talent was becoming
recognised; he had painted the two
altarpieces for SS. Ermagora and Fortunato, and
the offer he made to decorate the vast church
of his parish brought him conspicuously into
notice. In the first ardour of youth he completed
the &ldquo;Last Judgment&rdquo; for the choir.
From time to time, during fourteen years, he
redeemed his early promises and executed the
&ldquo;Golden Calf&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Presentation of the
Virgin.&rdquo; Within two years of his offer to
the Prior, came his first great opportunity of
achieving distinction. This was a commission
from the Confraternity of St. Mark, and with the
&ldquo;Miracle of the Slave&rdquo; he sprang at once to the
highest place.</p>

<p>The picture was universally admired, and was
followed by three more dealing with the patron
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>saint. At forty he married happily a beautiful
young girl, Faustina dei Vescovi, or Episcopi,
as it is indifferently given, the daughter of a
noble family of the mainland. Tradition has
always pointed to the girl in blue in the &ldquo;Golden
Calf&rdquo; as her portrait, while it is easy to recognise
Tintoretto himself in the black-bearded giant,
who helps to carry the idol. His house at this
time was somewhere in the Parrocchia dell&#8217; Orto,
and there, during the next fourteen years, eight
children were born, of whom the two eldest,
Domenico and Marietta, attained distinction in
their father&#8217;s profession. Another great event,
which profoundly influenced his life, was the
beginning of his connection in 1560 with the
Scuola di San Rocco, the great confraternity
which was devoted to combating the ravages of
the plague and to succouring the families of its
victims. His work for this lasted to the end of
his life and is his most distinguished memorial.</p>

<p>The palace to which the Robusti family
moved in 1574, and which was inhabited by his
descendants so late as 1830, can still be identified
in the Calle della Sensa. It is broken up into
two parts, but it is evident that it was a dwelling
of some importance, a good specimen of
Venetian Gothic. It still bears marks of considerable
decoration; the walls are sheathed in
marble plaques, and the first floor has rows of
Gothic windows in delicately carved frames and
little balconies of fretted marble. Zanetti, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>1771, gives an etching of a magnificent bronze
frieze cast from the master&#8217;s design, which ran
round the Grand Sala. The family must have
occupied the <em>piano nobile</em> and let off the floors
they did not require.</p>

<p>Descriptions of the life led by the painter and
his family are given by Vasari, who knew him
personally, and by Ridolfi, whose book was published
in 1646, and who must have known his
children, several of whom were still alive and
proud of their father&#8217;s fame. We hear of pleasant
evenings spent in the little palace, of the enthusiastic
love of music, Tintoretto himself and his
daughter being highly gifted. Among the
<em>habitu&eacute;s</em> were Zarlino, for twenty-five years
chapel-master of St. Mark&#8217;s, one of the fathers of
modern music; Bassano; and Veronese, who, in
spite of his love for magnificent entertainments,
was often to be found in Tintoretto&#8217;s pleasant
home. Poor Andrea Schiavone was always
welcome, and as time went on the house became
the haunt of all the cultured gentlemen and
<em>litterati</em> of Venice.</p>

<p>It is not difficult from the materials available
to form a sufficiently lively idea of this Venetian
citizen of the sixteenth century, as father and
husband, host and painter. Ridolfi has collected
a number of anecdotes, which space forbids me
to use, but which are all very characteristic. We
gather that he was a man of strong character,
generous, sincere and simple, decided in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>ways, caring little for the great world, but
open-handed and hospitable under his own roof,
observant of men and manners, and sometimes
rather brusque in dealing with bores and offensive
persons. Full of dry quiet humour and of good-natured
banter of his wife&#8217;s little weaknesses.
A man, too, of upright conduct and free, as far
as it can be ascertained, from any of those
laxities and infidelities, so freely quoted of
celebrated men and so easily condoned by his
age. Art was Tintoretto&#8217;s main preoccupation;
but he seems to have been a man of strong
religious bias, making a close study of the Bible,
and turning naturally in his last days to those
truths with which his art had made him familiar,
truths which he had represented with that touch
of mystic feeling which was the deepest part
of his nature.</p>

<p>His relations with the State commenced in
1574, when his offer to present a superb painting
of the Victory of Lepanto was made to and
accepted by the Council of Ten. Tintoretto
was rewarded by a Broker&#8217;s patent, and between
this and the &ldquo;Paradiso,&rdquo; the work of his old
age, he executed a number of pictures for the
Signoria. The only record of any travels are
confined to two journeys paid to Mantua, where
he went in the &#8217;sixties and again in 1579 to see
to the hanging of paintings done for the Gonzaga,
and of which the documents have been kept,
though the pictures have vanished. Tintoretto&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>last years were saddened by the death of his
beloved daughter, who had always been his
constant companion. He died in 1579 after a
fortnight&#8217;s illness and left a will, which, together
with that of his son, throws a good deal of light
upon the family history.</p>

<p>It is not easy to select from the vast quantity
of work left by Tintoretto. He is one of those
painters whose whole life was passed in his
native city and who can only be adequately
studied in that city. Perhaps the first place in
which to seek him, is the great church which
was the monument of his early prime. The
&ldquo;Last Judgment&rdquo; was probably inspired by that
of Michelangelo, of which descriptions and
sketches must have reached the younger master,
over whom the Florentine had exercised so
strong a fascination. Tintoretto&#8217;s version impresses
one as that of a mind boiling with
thoughts and visions which he pours out upon
the huge space. It depicts a terrible catastrophe,
a scene of rushing destruction, of forms swept
into oblivion, of others struggling to the light, of
many beautiful figures and of a flood of air and
light behind the rushing water,&mdash;water which
makes us almost giddy as we watch it. The
&ldquo;Golden Calf&rdquo; is a maturer production and includes
some of the loveliest women Tintoretto
ever painted. We see too plainly the planning,
the device of concentrating interest on the idol by
turning figures and pointing fingers, but nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>can be imagined more supple and queenly than
the woman in blue, and the way the light falls
on her head and perfectly foreshortened arm
shows to what excellence Tintoretto had attained.
The &ldquo;Presentation&rdquo; is a riper work. The
drawing of the flight of steps and of the groups
upon them could not be bettered. The little
figure of the Virgin, prototype of the new
dispensation, as she advances to meet the representative
of the old, thrills with mystic feeling,
yet the painter has contrived to retain the sturdy
simplicity of a child. The &ldquo;St. Agnes,&rdquo; with
its contrast of light and shade, of strength made
perfect in weakness, is of later date and was the
commission of Cardinal Contarini.</p>

<p>It is interesting to realise how Tintoretto,
especially in the &ldquo;Presentation,&rdquo; has contrived,
while using the traditional episodes, to infuse
so strong an imaginative sense. The contrast
of age and youth, the joy of the Gentiles, the
starlike figure of the child surrounded by shadows,
convey an emotional feeling, in harmony with
the nature of the scene.</p>

<p>Next let us group together the miracles in
the history of St. Mark. One of the qualities
which strikes us most in the &ldquo;Miracle of the
Slave&rdquo; is its strong local colour. It tells of
Titian and Bonifazio and is unlike Tintoretto&#8217;s
later style. The colours are glowing and gem-like;
carnations, orange-yellows, deep scarlet,
and turquoise-blue. The crimson velvet of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>judge&#8217;s dress is finely relieved against a blue-green
sky, and Tintoretto has kept that instinctive
fire and dash which culminates at once and
without effort in perfect action, &ldquo;as a bird flies,
or a horse gallops.&rdquo; It startled the quiet
members of the Guild, and at the first moment
they hesitated to accept it. The &ldquo;Rescue of
the Saracen&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Transportation of the
Body&rdquo; are more in the golden-brown manner
to which he was moving, but it is in the
&ldquo;Finding of the Body&rdquo; (Brera) that he rises to
the highest emotional pitch. The colossal form
of the saint, expanding with life and power as he
towers in the spirit above his own lifeless clay,
draws all eyes to him and seems to fill the
barrel-roofed hall with ease and energy. Every
part of the vault is flooded by his life-giving
energy, and here Tintoretto deals with light and
shade with full mastery.</p>

<p>As we follow Tintoretto&#8217;s career, it is borne
in upon us how little positive colour it takes to
make a great colourist. The whole Venetian
School, indeed, does not deal with what we understand
as bright colour. Vivid tints are much more
characteristic of the Flemish and the Florentine,
or, let us say, of the painters of to-day. Strong,
crude colours are to be seen on all sides in the
Salon or the Royal Academy, but they are
absent from the scheme of sombre splendour
which has given the Venetians their title to
fame. This is especially true of Tintoretto, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>it becomes more so as he advances. His gamut
becomes more golden-brown and mellow; the
greys and browns and ivories combine in a
lustrous symphony more impressive than gay
tints, flooded with enveloping shadow and
illumined by flashes of iridescent light. Another
noticeable feature is the way in which he
puts on his oil-colour, so that it bears the direct
impression of the painter&#8217;s hand. The Florentines
had used flat tints, opaque and with every brush-mark
smoothed away; but as the later Venetians
covered large spaces with oil-colour, they no
longer sought to dissimulate the traces of the
brush, and light, distance, movement, were all
conveyed by the turns and twists and swirls with
which the thin oil-colour was laid on. Look at
the power of touch in such a picture as the
&ldquo;Death of Abel&rdquo;; we see this spontaneity of
execution actually forming part of the emotion
with which the picture is charged. The concentrated
hate of the one figure, the desperate
appeal of the other, the lurid note of the landscape,
gain their emotion as much from the
impetuous brush-work as from the more studied
design. We come closest to the painter&#8217;s mind
in the Scuola di San Rocco. He had already
been employed in the church, and there remains,
darkened and ruined by damp, the series illustrative
of the career of S. Roch, patron saint of
sufferers from the plague. When the great
Halls of Assembly were to be decorated in 1560,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>the confraternity asked a conclave of painters,
among whom were Veronese and Andrea
Schiavone, to prepare sketches for competition.
When they assembled to display their designs,
Tintoretto swept aside a cartoon from the ceiling
of the refectory and discovered a finished picture,
the &ldquo;S. Roch in Glory,&rdquo; which still holds its
place there. Neither the other artists nor the
brethren seem to have approved of this unconventional
proceeding, but he &ldquo;hoped they would
not be offended; it was the only way he knew.&rdquo;
Partly from the displeased withdrawal of some of
the rest, but partly also from the excellence of
the work, the commission fell to Tintoretto, and
after two years&#8217; work he was received into the
order, and was assigned an annual provision of
100 ducats (&pound;50) a year for life, being bound
every year to furnish three pictures.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>TINTORETTO</strong> (<em>continued</em>)</p>

<p>The first portion of the vast building that was
finished was the Refectory, but in examining
the scheme, it is perhaps more convenient to
leave it to its proper place, which is the climax.
Before beginning, Tintoretto must have had the
whole thing planned, and we cannot doubt that
he was influenced by the Sixtine Chapel and
recalled its plan and significance; the old dispensation
typifying the new, the Old Testament
history vivified by the acts of Christ. The
main feature of the harmony which it is only
reasonable to suppose governs the whole building,
is its dedication to S. Roch, the special patron of
mercy. The principal paintings of the Upper
Hall are therefore concerned with acts of divine
mercy and deliverance, and even the monochromes
bear upon the central idea. On the roof are the
three most important miracles of mercy performed
on behalf of the Chosen People. The
paintings on roof and walls are linked together.
The &ldquo;Fall of Man&rdquo; at one end of the Hall, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>disobedient eating, corresponds with the obedient
eating of the Passover at the other, and is
interdependent with the Manna in the Wilderness,
the Last Supper, and the Miracle of the Loaves.
The Miracles of satisfied thirst are represented
by &ldquo;Moses striking the Rock,&rdquo; Samson drinking
from the jawbone and the waters of Meribah.
The Baptism and other signs of the Advent of
Christ and the Divine preparation, balance events
in the early life of Moses. In the Refectory
which opens from the Great Hall, we come to
the &ldquo;Crucifixion,&rdquo; the crowning act of mercy,
surrounded by the events which immediately
succeeded it, and typified immediately above in
the Central Hall, by the lifting up of the Brazen
Serpent. The miracles include six of refreshment
and succour, two of miraculous restoration
to health, and two of deliverance from danger.
The whole scheme has been worked out in
detail in my book on &ldquo;Tintoretto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the working out of his great scheme,
Tintoretto is impatient of hackneyed and traditional
forms; he must have a reading of his own,
and one which appeals to his imagination. We
see that passion for movement which distinguishes
his early work. &ldquo;Moses striking the Rock&rdquo; is a
figure instinct with purpose and energy. The
water bounds forth, living, life-giving, the people
strain wildly to reach it. His figures are sometimes
found fault with, as extravagant in gesture,
but the attitudes were intended to be seen and to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>arrest attention from far below, and we must not
forget that the painter&#8217;s models were drawn from
a Southern race, to whom emphasis of action is
natural. Tintoretto, it may be conceded, is on
certain occasions, generally when dealing with
accessory figures, inclined to excess of gesture;
it is the defect of his temperament, but when he
has a subject that carries him away he is sincere
and never violent in spirit. Titian is cold compared
to him; his colour, however effective, is
calculated, whereas Tintoretto&#8217;s seems to permeate
every object and to soak the whole composition.
To quote a recent critic: &ldquo;He chose to begin, if
possible, with a subject charged with emotion.
He then proceeded to treat it according to its
nature, that is to say, he toned down and obscured
the outlines of form and mapped out the subject
instead in pale or sombre masses of light and
shade. Under the control of this powerful
scheme of chiaroscuro, the colouring of the
composition was placed, but its own character,
its degree of richness and sobriety, was determined
by the kind of emotion belonging to the subject.
To use colour in this way, not only with
emotional force, but with emotional truth, is to
use it to perform one of the greatest functions
of art.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>So in the Crucifixion it is not so much the
aspect of the groups, the pathos of the faces
or gestures, that tells, but it is the mystery and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>gloom in which the whole scene is muffled, the
atmosphere into which we are absorbed, the
sense of livid terror conveyed by the brooding
light and shadow, that makes us feel how different
the rendering is from any other. In the &ldquo;Christ
before Pilate&rdquo; the head and figure of Christ are
not particularly impressive in themselves, but
the brilliant light falling on the white robes and
coursing down the steps supplies dignity and
poetry; the slender white figure stands out
like a shaft of light against the lurid and
troubled background. Again, in the &ldquo;Way to
Golgotha&rdquo; the falling evening gleam, the wild
sky, the deep shadow of the ravine, throw into
relief the quiet form, detached in look and
feeling, as of one upborne by the spirit far
above the brutal throng. Nowhere does that
spiritual emotion find deeper expression than
in the &ldquo;Visitation.&rdquo; The passion of thanksgiving,
the poignancy of mother-love, throb
through the two women, who have been
travelling towards one another, with a great
secret between them, and who at length reach
the haven of each other&#8217;s love and knowledge.
Here, too, the dying light, the waving tree,
the obliteration of form, and the feeling of
mystery make a deep appeal to the sensuous
apprehension. We find it again and again; the
great trees sway and whisper in the gathering
darkness as the Virgin rides through the falling
evening shadows, clasping her Babe, and in that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>most moving of all Tintoretto&#8217;s creations, the
&ldquo;S. Mary of Egypt,&rdquo; the emotional mood of
Nature&#8217;s self is brought home to us. The trees
that dominate the landscape are painted with
a few &ldquo;strokes like sabre cuts&rdquo;; the landscape,
given with apparent carelessness, yet conveying
an indescribable sense of space and solemnity,
unfolds itself under the dying day; and in solitary
meditation, thrilling with ecstasy, sits that little
figure, whose heart has travelled far away to
commune with the Spirit, &ldquo;whose dwelling is
the light of setting suns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not possible in a short space to touch,
even in passing, on all the many scenes in these
halls: the &ldquo;Annunciation,&rdquo; with its marvellous
flight of cherubs, reminding us of the flight of
pigeons in the Piazza, and how often the old
painter must have watched them; the &ldquo;Temptation,&rdquo;
contrasting the throbbing evil, the flesh
that <em>must</em> be fed, with the calm of absolute
purity; the &ldquo;Massacre of the Innocents,&rdquo; for
which the horrors of sacked towns could have
supplied many a parallel,&mdash;we have not time to
dwell on these, but we may notice how the artist
has overcome the difficulty of seeing clearly in the
dark halls, by choosing strong and varied effects
of light for the most shadowed spaces, and we
can picture what the halls must have been like
when they first glowed from his hand, adorned
with gilded fretwork and moulding, and hung
with opulent draperies, with the rose-red and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>purple of bishops&#8217; and cardinals&#8217; robes reflected in
the gleaming pavement.</p>

<p>Leonardo, by one supreme example, Tintoretto,
by many renderings, have made the &ldquo;Last
Supper&rdquo; peculiarly their own in the domain of
art. It shows how strongly the mystic strain
entered into the man&#8217;s character, that often as
Tintoretto treated the subject, it never lost its
interest for him, and he never failed to find a fresh
point of view. In that in S. Polo, Christ offers
the sacred food with a gesture of vehement
generosity. Placed as the picture is, to appeal to
all comers to the Mass, to afford them a welcome
as they pass to the High Altar, it tells of the
Bread of Life given to all mankind. Tintoretto
himself, painted in the character of S. Paul,
stands at one side, absorbed in meditation. We
need not insist again on the emotional value of
the deep colours, the rich creams and crimsons
and the chiaroscuro. In his latest rendering, in
S. Giorgio Maggiore, he touches his highest point
in symbolical treatment. Some people are only
able to see a theatrical, artificial spirit in this
picture, but at least, when we consider what
deep meditation Tintoretto had bestowed on
his subjects, we may believe that he himself was
sincere and that he let himself go over what
commended itself as an entirely new rendering.
&ldquo;The Light shined in the Darkness, and the
Darkness comprehended it not.&rdquo; The supernatural
is entering on every side, but the feast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>goes on; the serving men and maids busy themselves
with the dishes; the disciples are inquiring,
but not agitated; none see that throng of
heavenly visitants, pouring in through the blue
moonlight, called to their Master&#8217;s side by the
supreme significance of His words. The painter
has taken full advantage of the opportunity of
combining the light of the cresset lamp, pouring
out smoky clouds, with the struggling moonlight
and the unearthly radiance, in divers, yet
mingling streams which fight against the surrounding
gloom. In the scene in the Scuola
di S. Rocco the betrayal is the dominating
incident, and in San Stefano all is peace, and the
Saviour is alone with the faithful disciples.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Tintoretto.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BACCHUS AND ARIADNE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Ducal Palace, Venice.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Anderson.</em>)</p>

<p>Though several of the large compositions
ascribed to Tintoretto in the Ducal Palace are
only partly by him, or entirely by followers and
imitators, its halls are still a storehouse of his
genius. There is much that is fine about the
great state pieces. In the &ldquo;Marriage of St.
Catherine,&rdquo; the saint, in silken gown and
long transparent veil, is an exquisite figure.
Tintoretto bathes all his pageantry in golden
light and air, and yet we feel that these huge
official subjects, with the prosaic old Doges
introduced in incongruous company, neither
stimulated his imagination nor satisfied his taste.
It is on the smaller canvases that he finds inspiration.
He never painted anything more lovely,
more perfect in design, or more gay and tender in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>idea, than the cycle in the Ante-Collegio. The
glowing light and exquisitely graded shadows
upon ivory limbs have a sensuous perfection and
a refined, unselfconscious joy such as is felt in
hardly any other work, except the painter&#8217;s own
&ldquo;Milky Way&rdquo; in the National Gallery. In all
these four pictures the feeling for design, a
branch of art in which Tintoretto was past master,
is fully displayed. In the Bacchus and Ariadne
all the principal lines, the eyes and gestures,
converge upon the tiny ring which is the symbol
of union between the goddess and her lover,
between the queenly city and the Adriatic sea.
Or take &ldquo;Pallas driving away Mars&rdquo;: see how
the mass into which the figures are gathered on
the left adds strength to the thrust of the
goddess&#8217;s arm, and what steadiness is given by
that short straight lance of hers, coming in
among all the yielding curves. The whole four
are linked together in meaning: the call to
Venice to reign over the seas, her triumphant
peace, with Wisdom guiding her council, and her
warriors forging arms in case of need. In conjunction
with these pictures are two small ones
in the chapel, hardly less beautiful&mdash;St. George
with St. Margaret, and SS. Andrew and Jerome.
It is difficult to say whether the exultant St.
George, the dignified young bishop, or the two
older saints are the more sympathetic creations,
or the more admirable, both in drawing and
colour. The sense of space in both settings is an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>added charm, and every scrap of detail, the leafy
boughs, the cross and crozier, is important to the
composition.</p>

<p>There are many other striking examples,
ranging all through Tintoretto&#8217;s life, of his
untiring imagination. In the Salute is that
&ldquo;Marriage of Cana,&rdquo; in which all the actors
seem to swim in golden light. The sharp
silhouettes bring out an effect of radiant sunshine
with which the hall is flooded, and all the
architectural lines lead our eyes towards the
central figure, placed at a distance. On that
long canvas in the Academy, kneel the three
treasurers, pouring out their gold and bending in
homage before the Madonna and Child, who sit
enthroned upon a broad piazza, through the
marble pillars of which a blue and distant landscape
shines. Grave senators in mulberry velvet
and ermine kneel before the Child, or hold
counsel on Paduan affairs under the patronage of
S. Giustina. The &ldquo;Crucifixion&rdquo; (in S. Cassiano)
is another triumph of the painter&#8217;s imaginative
conception. The bold lines of the crosses,
the ladder, and the figures detach against a
glorious sky, and the presence of the moving,
murmuring throng, of which, by the placing of
the line of sight, the spectator is made to form
a part, is conveyed by the swaying and crossing
of the lances borne by the armed men who keep
the ground. There is a series, too, which deals
with the Magdalen. She mourns her dead in that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>solemn, restrained &ldquo;Entombment,&rdquo; where the enfolding
shadows frame the cross against the sad
dawn, which adorns the mortuary chapel of S.
Giorgio Maggiore; and the Piet&agrave; in the Brera, the
long lines of which add to the impression of tender
repose, has its peace broken by the passionate cry
of the woman who loved much. Tintoretto&#8217;s
ideas are exhaustless; he can paint the same
scene in a dozen different ways, and, in fact,
the book of sketches lately acquired by the
British Museum shows as many as thirty trials
dashed off for one subject, and after all he uses
one composed for something quite different. It
is this habit of throwing off red-hot essays, fresh
from his brain, that has led to the common but
superficial judgment that Tintoretto was merely
a great improvisatore, whose successes came more
or less by good luck. He could, indeed, paint
pictures at a pace at which many great masters
could only sketch, but he had already designed
and considered and rejected, doing with oil,
ink, and paper what many of his contemporaries
did mentally. Such achievements as the
Ante-Collegio cycle, the &ldquo;House of Martha
and Mary,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Marriage of Cana,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Temptation of S. Anthony,&rdquo; to name only a
few, show a finish and perfection and a balance
of design which preclude the idea of their being
lightly painted pictures. When he was actually
engaged, Tintoretto let himself go with impetuous
ardour, but we may feel assured he left
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>nothing to chance, though he had his own way
of making sure of the result.</p>

<p>It is strange to hear people, as one does now
and then, talking of the &ldquo;Paradiso&rdquo; as &ldquo;a splendid
failure.&rdquo; It may be granted that the subject is
an impossible one for human art to realise, yet
when all allowance has been made for a lamentable
amount of drying and blackening, it is difficult
to agree that Ruskin was all wrong in his
admiration of that thronging multitude, ordered
and disciplined by the tides of light and shadow,
which roll in and out of the masses, resolving
them into groups and single figures of almost
matchless beauty and melting away into a sea
of radiant ether, which tells us of the boundless
space which surrounds the serried ranks of the
Blessed.</p>

<p>Tintoretto was seventy-eight when it was
allotted to him, and it was the last great effort of
his mind and hand. Studies for it are preserved
both at the Louvre and at Madrid, and it is
evident that the painter has framed it upon
the thought of Dante&#8217;s mystic rose. The circles
and many of the figures can be traced in the
poem, and the idea of the Eternal Light streaming
through the leaves of the rose dominates the
composition. It is appropriate that it should
have been his last great work, as it was also
the greatest attempt at composition ever made
by a master of the Venetian School.</p>

<p>There is no room here to study Tintoretto as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>a painter of battlepieces, though from the time
he painted the &ldquo;Battle of Lepanto,&rdquo; for the
Council of Ten, he often returned to such
subjects. His two series for the Gonzaga included
several, and the Ducal Palace still possesses
examples. The impetuosity of his style stood
him in good stead, and he never fails to bring in
graceful and striking figures.</p>

<p>His portraits are hardly equal to Titian&#8217;s
intellectual grasp or fine-grained colour, but they
are extraordinarily characteristic. He prefers to
paint men rather than women, and he painted
hundreds&mdash;all the great persons of his time who
lived in and visited Venice. The Venetian
portrait by this time was expected to be more
than a likeness and more than a problem. It was
to please the taste as a picture, to interest and to
satisfy criticism. Tintoretto, like Lotto, gets
behind the scenes, and we see some mood, some
aspect of the sitter that he hardly expected to
show. His penetration is not equal to Lotto&#8217;s,
but he deals with his sitters with an observation
which pierces below the surface.</p>

<p>In criticising Tintoretto, men seem often
unable to discriminate between the turgid and
melodramatic, and the spontaneous and temperamental.
The first all must abhor, but the last
is sincere and deserves to be respected. It is by
his best that we must judge a man, and taking
his best and undoubtedly authentic work, no one
has left a larger amount which will stand the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>test of criticism. As an exponent of lofty and
elevated central ideas, which unify all parts
of his composition, Tintoretto stands with the
greatest imaginative minds. The intellectual
side of life was exemplified in Florentine art,
but the Renaissance would have been a one-sided
development if there had not arisen a body of
men to whom emotion and the gift of sensuous
apprehension seemed of supreme value, and at
the very last there arose with him one who, to
their philosophy of feeling and the mastery of
their chosen medium, added the crowning glory
of the imaginative idea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BASSANO</strong></p>


<p>We wonder how many of those sightseers who
pass through the Ante-Collegio in the Ducal
Palace, and stare for a few moments at Tintoretto&#8217;s
famous quartet and at Veronese&#8217;s &ldquo;Rape of
Europa,&rdquo; turn to give even such fleeting attention
to the long, dark canvas which hangs beside
them, &ldquo;Jacob&#8217;s Journey into Canaan,&rdquo; by Jacopo
da Ponte, called Bassano.</p>

<p>Yet from the position in which it is placed
the visitor might guess that it is considered to be
a gem, and it gains something in interest when we
learn from Zanetti that it was ordered by Jacopo
Contarini at the same time as the &ldquo;Rape of
Europa,&rdquo; as if the great connoisseur enjoyed
contrasting Veronese&#8217;s light, gay style with the
vigorous brush of da Ponte.</p>

<p>If attention is arrested by the beauty of the
painting, and the visitor should be inspired to
seek the painter in his native city, he will be
well repaid. Bassano once held an important
position on the main road between Italy and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>Germany, but since the railroad was made across
the Brenner Pass, few people ever see the little
town which lies cradled on the spurs of the
Italian Alps, where the gorge of Valsugana
opens. It is surrounded by chestnut woods,
which sweep up to the blue mountains, the wide
Brenta flows through the town, and the houses
cluster high on either side, and have gardens and
balconies overhanging the water. The fa&ccedil;ades
of many of the houses are covered with fading
frescoes, relics of da Ponte&#8217;s school of fresco-painters,
which, though they are fast perishing,
still give a wonderful effect of warmth and colour.</p>

<p>Jacopo da Ponte was the son and pupil of his
father, Francesco, who in his day had been a
pupil of the Vicentine, Bartolommeo Montagna.
Francesco da Ponte&#8217;s best work is to be found
at Bassano, in the cathedral and the church of
San Giovanni, and has many of the characteristics,
such as the raised pedestal and vaulted cupola,
which we have noticed that Montagna owed to
the Vivarini. Francesco&#8217;s son went when very
young to Venice, and was there thrown at once
among the artists of the lagoons, and attached
himself in particular to Bonifazio. In Jacopo&#8217;s
earliest work, now in the Museum at Bassano, a
&ldquo;Flight into Egypt,&rdquo; Bonifazio&#8217;s tuition is
markedly discernible in the build of the figures
and, above all, in the form of the heads. A
comparison of the very peculiarly shaped head
of the Virgin in this picture with that of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Venetian lady in Bonifazio&#8217;s &ldquo;Rich Man&#8217;s Feast,&rdquo;
in the Venetian Academy, leaves us in no doubt
on this score. Jacopo&#8217;s &ldquo;Adulteress before
Christ&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Three in the Fiery Furnace&rdquo;
have Bonifazio&#8217;s manner in the architecture and
the staging of the figures. Only five examples
are known of this early work of da Ponte, and it
is all in Bonifazio&#8217;s lighter style, not unlike his
&ldquo;Holy Family&rdquo; in the National Gallery.</p>

<p>The house in which the painter lived when
he returned to his native town, still stands in the
little Piazza Monte Vecchio, and its whole fa&ccedil;ade
retains the frescoes, mouldy and decaying, with
which he decorated it. The design is in four
horizontal bands. First comes a frieze of
children in every attitude of fun and frolic.
Then follows a long range of animals&mdash;horses,
oxen, and deer. Musical instruments and flowers
make a border, with allegorical representations
of the arts and crafts filling the spaces between
the windows. The principal band is decorated
with Scriptural subjects, most of which are now
hardly discernible, but which represent &ldquo;Samson
slaying the Philistines,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Drunkenness
of Noah,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cain and Abel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lot and his
Daughters,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Judith with the Head of
Holofernes.&rdquo; Between the two last there
formerly appeared a drawing of a dead child,
with the motto, &ldquo;Mors omnia aequat,&rdquo; which
was removed to the Museum in 1883, in comparatively
good preservation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p><p>Jacopo da Ponte lived a busy life at Bassano,
where, with the help of his four sons, who were
all painters, he poured out an inexhaustible
stream of works, which, it is said, were put up
to auction at the neighbouring fairs, if no other
market was forthcoming. From time to time
he and his sons went down to Venice, and with
the help of the eldest, Francesco, Bassano (as he
is generally known) painted the &ldquo;Siege of Padua&rdquo;
and five other works in the Ducal Palace. His
mature style was founded mainly upon that of
Titian, and it is to this second manner that he
owes his fame. He makes use of fewer colours,
and enhances his lights by deepening and consolidating
his shadows, so that they come into
strong contrast, and his technique gains a richer
impasto. He has a marvellous faculty for keeping
his colour pure, and his greens shine like a
beetle&#8217;s wing. A nature-lover in the highest
degree, his painting of animals and plants evinces
a mind which is steeped in the magic of outdoor
life. A subject of which he was particularly
fond, and which he seems to have undertaken for
half the collectors of Europe, was the &ldquo;Four
Seasons.&rdquo; Here was found united everything
that Bassano most loved to paint: beasts of the
farmyard and countryside, agriculturists with
their implements, scenes of harvest-time and
vintage, rough peasants leading the plough,
cutting the grass, harvesting the grain, young
girls making hay, driving home the cattle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>taking dinner to the reapers. When he was
obliged to paint for churches he chose such
subjects as the Adoration of the Shepherds, the
Sacrifice of Noah, the Expulsion from the
Temple, into which he could introduce animals,
painting them with such vigour and such forcible
colour that Titian himself is said to have had
a copy hanging in his studio. He loved to paint
his daughters engaged in household tasks, and
perhaps placed his figures with rather too obvious
a reference to light and shade, and to the sun
striking full on sunburnt cheeks and buxom
shoulders. A friend, not a rival, of Veronese
and Tintoretto, Gianbattista Volpado, records
that when he was one day discussing contemporary
painters with the latter, Tintoretto
exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah, Jacopo, if you had my drawing
and I had your colour I would defy the devil
himself to enable Titian, Raphael, and the rest to
make any show beside us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bassano was invited to take up his residence
at the Court of the Emperor Rudolph, but he
refused to leave his mountain city, where he died
in 1592. His funeral was attended by a crowd
of the poorest inhabitants, for whom his charity
had been boundless.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Journey of Jacob,&rdquo; to which we have
already alluded, is among his most beautiful
works. The brilliant array of figures is subordinated
to the charm of the landscape. The
evening dusk draws all objects into its embrace.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>The long, low, deep-blue distance stands out
against a gleam of sunset sky. The tree-trunks
and light play of leafy branches, which break
up the composition, are from da Ponte&#8217;s own
country round Bassano. The pony upon which
the boy scrambles, the cows, the dog among
the quiet sheep, are given with all the loving
truth of the born animal-painter. It is no
wonder that Teniers borrowed ideas from him,
and has more than once imitated his whole
design.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Baptism of St. Lucilla&rdquo; (in the Museum
at Bassano) is one of his most Titianesque
creations. The personages in it are grouped
upon a flight of steps, in front of a long Renaissance
palace with cypresses against a sky of
evening-red barred with purple clouds. The
drawing and modelling of the figures are almost
faultless, and the colour is dazzling. The bending
figure of S. Lucilla, with the light falling
on her silvery satin dress, as she kneels before
the young bishop, St. Valentine, is one of the
most graceful things in art, and Titian himself
need not have disowned the little angels, bearing
palm branches and frolicking in the stream of
radiance overhead.</p>

<p>Bassano has a &ldquo;Concert,&rdquo; which is interesting
as a family piece. It was painted in the year
in which his son Leandro&#8217;s marriage took place,
and is probably a bridal painting to celebrate
the event. The &ldquo;Magistrates in Adoration&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>(Vicenza) again gives a brilliant effect of light,
and its stately ceremonial is founded on Tintoretto&#8217;s
numerous pictures of kneeling doges
and procurators in fur-trimmed velvet robes.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Jacopo da Ponte.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BAPTISM OF S. LUCILLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Bassano.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Alinari.</em>)</p>

<p>Madonnas and saints are usually built into
close-packed pyramids, but in the &ldquo;Repose in
Egypt,&rdquo; now in the Ambrosiana, Milan, his
arrangement comes very close to Palma and
Lotto. The beautiful Mother and Child, the
attendants, above all the St. Joseph, resting,
head on hand, at the Virgin&#8217;s feet and gazing
in rapt adoration on the Child, are examples of
the true Venetian manner, while the exquisite
landscape behind them, and the vigorously drawn
tree under which they recline, show Bassano
true to his passion for nature.</p>

<p>Hampton Court is rich in his pictures.
&ldquo;The Adoration of the Shepherds,&rdquo; in which
the pillars rise behind the sacred group, is an
exercise in the manner of Titian&#8217;s Frari altarpiece.
His portraits are fine and sympathetic,
but hardly any of them are signed or can be
dated. His own is in the Uffizi, and there is a
splendid &ldquo;Old Man&rdquo; at Buda-Pesth. Ariosto
and Tasso, Sebastian Venier, and many other
distinguished men were among his sitters; most
of them are in half-length with three-quarter
heads. The National Gallery possesses a singularly
attractive one of a young man with a
sensitive, acute countenance, robed in dignified,
picturesque black, relieved by an embroidered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>linen collar. He stands by the sort of square
window, opening on a distant landscape, of which
Tintoretto and Lotto so often made use, in front
of which a golden vase, holding a branch of
olive, catches the rays of light.</p>

<p>Bassano has no great power of design, and
his knowledge of the nude seems to have been
small, but his brushwork is facile, and his colour
leaps out with a vivid beauty which obliterates
other shortcomings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE INTERIM</strong></p>


<p>Many of the churches and palaces of Venice
and the adjoining mainland, and almost every
public and private gallery throughout Europe,
contain pictures purporting to be painted by
Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, and others of that
famous company. Hardly a great English house
but boasts of a round dozen at least of such
specimens, acquired in the days when rich
Englishmen made the &ldquo;grand tour&rdquo; and substantiated
a reputation for taste and culture by
collecting works of art. These pictures resemble
the genuine article in a specious yet half-hearted
way. Their owners themselves are not very
tenacious as to their authenticity, and the visit
of an expert, or the ordeal of a public exhibition
tears their pretensions to tatters. In the
Academia itself the Bonifazio and Tintoretto
rooms are crowded with imitations. The Ducal
Palace has ceilings and panels on which are
reproduced the kind of compositions initiated
by the great artists, which make an effort to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>capture their gamut of colour and to master
their scheme of chiaroscuro, copying them, in
short, in everything except in their inimitable
touch and fire and spirit. It would have been
impossible for any men, however industrious
and prolific, to have carried out all the work
which passes under their names, to say nothing
of that which has perished; but our surprise and
curiosity diminish when we come to inquire
systematically into the methods of that host of
copyists which, even before the masters&#8217; death,
had begun to ply its lucrative trade.</p>

<p>We must bear in mind that every great man
was surrounded by busy and attentive satellites,
helping him to finish and, indeed, often painting
a large part of important commissions, witnesses
of the high prices received, and alive to all the
gossip as to the relative popularity of the
painters and the requests and orders which
reached them from all quarters. The painters&#8217;
own sons were in many instances those who
first traded upon their fathers&#8217; fame. From
Ridolfi, Zanetti, or Boschini we learn of the
many paintings executed by Carlotto Caliari and
the vast numbers painted by Domenico Robusti
in the style of their respective fathers. Domenico
seems to have particularly affected the subject of
&ldquo;St. George and the Dragon,&rdquo; and the picture at
Dresden, which passes under Tintoretto&#8217;s name, is
perhaps by his hand. Of Bassano&#8217;s four sons, Francesco
&ldquo;imitated his father perfectly,&rdquo; conserving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>his warmth of tint, his relief and breadth. Zanetti
enumerates a surprising number of Francesco&#8217;s
works, seven of them being painted for the Ducal
Palace. Leandro followed more particularly his
father&#8217;s first manner, was a good portrait-painter,
and possessed lightness and fancy. Girolamo
copied and recopied the old Bassano till he
even deceived connoisseurs, &ldquo;how much more,&rdquo;
says Zanetti, writing in 1771, &ldquo;those of the
present day, who behold them harmonised and
accredited by time.&rdquo; No school in Venice was
so beloved, or lent itself so well to the efforts
of the imitators, as that of Paolo Veronese.
Even at an early date it was impossible not to
confound the master with the disciples; the
weaker of the originals were held to be of
imitators, the best imitations were assigned to
the master himself. &ldquo;Oh how easy it is,&rdquo;
exclaims Zanetti again, &ldquo;to make mistakes about
Veronese&#8217;s pictures, but I can point out sundry
infallible characteristics to those who wish for
light upon this doubtful path; the fineness
and lightness of the brushwork, the sublime
intelligence and grace, shown particularly in
the form of the heads, which is never found in
any of his imitators.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few Venetians, however, followed the style
of only one man; the output was probably
determined and varied by the demand. Too
many attractive manners existed to dazzle them,
and when once they began to imitate, they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>tempted on all hands. It must also be remembered
that every master left behind him
stacks of cartoons, sketches and suggestions, and
half-finished pictures, which were eagerly seized
upon, bought or stolen, and utilised to produce
masterpieces masquerading under his name.</p>

<p>As the seventeenth century advanced the
character of art and manners underwent a
change. Men sought the beautiful in the novel
and bizarre, and the complex was preferred to
the simple. Venetian art, in all its branches,
had passed from the stately and restrained to
the pompous and artificial. Yet the barocco
style was used by Venice in a way of its own;
whimsical, contorted, and overloaded with ornament
as it is, it yet compels admiration by its
vigorous life and movement. The art of the
sei-cento in Venice was extravagant, but it was
alive. It escaped the most deadly of all faults,
a cold and academic mannerism&mdash;and this at a
time when the rest of Italy was given over to
the inflated followers of Michelangelo and the
calculated elaborations of the eclectics.</p>

<p>Many of the things we most love in Venice,
such as the Salute, the Clock-Tower, the
Dogana, the Bridge of Sighs, the Rezzonico
and Pesaro Palaces, are additions of the seventeenth
century. The barocco intemperance in
sculpture was carried on by disciples of Bernini;
and as the immediate influence of the great
masters declined, painting acquired the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>sort of character. The carelessness and rapidity
of Tintoretto, which, in his case, proceeded from
the lightning speed of his imagination and
the unerring sureness of his brush, became a
mechanical trick in the hands of superficial
students. True art had migrated elsewhere&mdash;to
the homes of Velasquez, Rubens, and Rembrandt.
As art grew more pompous it became less
emotional. Painters like Palma Giovine spoilt
their ready, lively fancy by the vice of hurry.
The nickname of &ldquo;Fa Presto&rdquo; was deserved by
others besides Luca Giordano, and Venice was
overrun by a swarm of painters whose prime
standard of excellence was the ability to make
haste. Grandeur of conception was forgotten;
a grave, ample manner was no longer understood;
superficial sentiment and bombastic size
carried the day. Yet a few painters, though
their forms had become redundant and exaggerated,
retained something of what had been
the Venetian glory&mdash;the deep and moist colour
of old. It still glowed with traces of its old
lustre on the canvases of Giovanni Contarini,
or Tiberio Tinelli, or Pietro Liberi; and
though there was a perfect fury of production,
without order and without law, there can still
be perceived the survival of that sense of the
decorative which kept the thread of art. We
discover it in the ceiling of the Church of San
Pantaleone, where Gianbattista Fumiani paints
the glorification of the martyred patron, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>which, fantastic and extravagant as it is, with
its stupendous, architectural setting, and its
acutely, almost absurdly foreshortened throng,
is not without a certain grandiose geniality,
ample and picturesque, like the buildings of
that date. In Alessandro Varotari (il Padovanino),
whose &ldquo;Nozze di Cana&rdquo; in the Academia is a
finely spaced scene, in which a charming use is
made of cypresses, we seem to recognise the last
ray of the Titianesque. The painting of the seventeenth
century passed on towards the eighteenth,
and, from ceilings and panels, rosy nymphs and
Venuses smile at us, attitudinising and contorted
upon their cloudy backgrounds. Lackadaisical
Magdalens drop sentimental tears, and the
Angel of the Annunciation capers above the
head of an affected Virgin, while violent colours,
intensified chiaroscuro, and black greasy impasto
betray the neighbourhood of the <em>tenebrosi</em>.
When, towards the end of the seventeenth
century, Gregorio Lazzarini set himself to shake
off these influences, he went to the opposite
extreme. Although a beautiful designer, he
becomes cold and flat in colour, with a coldness
and insipidity, indeed, that take us by surprise,
appearing in a country where the taste for
luminous and brilliant tints was so strongly
rooted. The student of Venetian painting, who
wishes to fill up the hiatus which lies between
the Golden Age and the revival of the eighteenth
century, cannot do better than compare Fumiani&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>vault in San Pantaleone with Lazzarini&#8217;s sober
and earnest fresco, &ldquo;The Charity of San Lorenzo
Giustiniani,&rdquo; in San Pietro in Castello, and with
Pietro Liberi&#8217;s &ldquo;Battle of the Dardanelles&rdquo; in
the Ducal Palace. In all three we have
examples of the varied and accomplished yet
soulless art of this period. Not many of the
scenes painted for the palaces of patricians in the
seventeenth century have survived. They are
to be found here and there by the curious who
wander into old churches and palaces with a
second-hand copy of Boschini in their hands;
but in the reaction from the florid which took
place in the Empire period, many of them gave
place to whitewash and stucco. In the Ducal
Palace, side by side with the masterpieces of the
Renaissance, are to be found the overcrowded
canvases of Vicentino, Giovanni Contarini,
Pietro Liberi, Celesti, and others like them.
Some of the poor and meretricious mosaics in
St. Mark&#8217;s are from designs by Palma Giovine
and Fumiani. Carlo Ridolfi, who was a painter
himself, as well as the painter&#8217;s chronicler, has
an &ldquo;Adoration of the Magi&rdquo; in S. Giovanni
Elemosinario, poor enough in invention and
execution. Two pictures by obscure artists
disfigure a corner of the Scuola di San Rocco.
The Museo Civico has a large canvas by
Vicentino, a &ldquo;Coronation of a Dogaressa,&rdquo; which
once adorned Palazzo Grimani. We hear of a
school opened by Antonio Balestra, who was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>master of Rosalba Carriera and Pietro Longhi,
and the names of others have come down to us
in numbers too numerous to be quoted. Towards
the end of the seventeenth century more
light and novelty sparkles in the painting of
the Bellunese, Battista Ricci, and assures us
that he was no mere copyist; and, as the eighteenth
century opens, we become aware of the
strong and daring brush of Gianbattista Piazetta.
Piazetta studied the works of the Carracci for
some time in Bologna, and especially those of
Guercino, whose style, with its bold contrasts
of light and shade, has served above all as his
model. He paints very darkly, and his figures
often blend with and disappear into the profound
tones of his backgrounds. Charles Blanc calls
him &ldquo;a Venetian Caravaggio&rdquo;; and he has
something of the strength and even the brutality
of the Bolognese. A fine decorative and imaginative
example of his work is the &ldquo;Madonna
appearing to S. Philip Neri&rdquo; in the Church of
S. Fava. The erect form of the Madonna is
relieved in striking chiaroscuro against the
mantle, upheld by <em>putti</em>. Radiant clouds light
up the background and illumine the form of the
old saint, a refined and spirited figure, gazing at
the vision in an ecstasy of devotion. Piazetta is
a bold realist, and many of his small pictures
are strong and forcible. Sebastiano Ricci,
Battista&#8217;s son, is described as &ldquo;a fine intelligence,&rdquo;
and attracts our notice as having forged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>special links with England. Hampton Court
possesses a long array of his paintings. In the
chapel of Chelsea Hospital the plaster semi-dome
is painted by him, in oils, with very good
effect. He is said to have worked in Thornhill&#8217;s
studio, and his influence may be suspected in
the Blenheim frescoes, and even in touches in
Hogarth&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>By the eighteenth century Venice had parted
with her old nobility of soul, and enjoyment
had become the only aim of life. Yet Venice,
among the States of Italy, alone retained her
freedom. The Doge reigned supreme as in
the past. Beneath the ceiling of Veronese the
dreaded Three still sat in secret council. Venice
was still the city of subtle poisons and dangerous
mysteries, but the days were gone when she had
held the balance in European affairs, and she
had become, in a superlative degree, the city of
pleasure. Nowhere was life more varied and
entertaining, more full of grace and enchantment.</p>

<p>A long period of peace had rocked the
Venetian people into calm security. There was,
indeed, a little spasmodic fighting in Corf&ugrave;,
Dalmatia, and Algiers, but no real share was
retained in the struggles of Europe. The whole
policy of the city&#8217;s life was one of self-indulgence.
Holiday-makers filled her streets; the whole
population lived &ldquo;in piazza,&rdquo; laughing, gossiping,
seeing and being seen. The very churches
had become a rendezvous for fashionable intrigues;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>the convents boasted their <em>salons</em>, where nuns
in low dresses, with pearls in their hair, received
the advances of nobles and gallant abb&eacute;s. People
came to Venice to waste time; trivialities, the
last scandal, sensational stories, were the only
subjects worth discussing. In an age of parodies
and practical jokes, the more absurd any one
could be, the more silly or witty stories he
could tell, the more assured was his success in
the joyous, frivolous circle, full of fun and
laughter. The Carnival lasted for six months
of the year, and was the occasion for masques
and licence of every description. In the hot
weather, the gay descendants of the Contarini, the
Loredan, the Pisani, and other grand old houses,
migrated to villas along the Brenta, where by day
and night the same reckless, irresponsible life
went gaily on. The power of such courtesans
as Titian and Paris Bordone had painted was
waning. Their place was adequately supplied
by the easy dames of society, no longer secluded,
proud and tranquil, but &ldquo;stirred by the wild
blood of youth and stooping to the frolic.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They are but faces and smiles, teasing and
trumpery,&rdquo; says one of their critics, yet they
are declared to be wideawake, natural and
charming, making the most of their smattering
of letters. Love was the great game; every
woman had lovers, every married woman openly
flaunted her <em>cicisbeo</em> or <em>cavaliere servente</em>.</p>

<p>The older portion of the middle class was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>still moderate and temperate, contented to live
in the old fashion, eschewing all interest in
politics, with which it was dangerous for the
ordinary individual to meddle; but the new
leaven was creeping through every level of
society. The sons and daughters of the
<em>bourgeoisie</em> tried to rise in the social scale by
aping the pleasant vices of the aristocracy. They
deserted the shop and the counting-house to play
cards and strut upon the piazza. They mimicked
the fine gentleman and the gentildonna, and
made fashionable love and carried on intrigues.
The spirit of the whole people had lost its
elevation; there were no more proud patricians,
full of noble ambitions and devoted zeal of public
service; it was hardly possible to get a sufficient
number of persons to carry on public business.
It is a contemptible indictment enough; yet
among all this degenerate life, we come upon
something more real as we turn to the artists.
They were very much alive. In music, in
literature, and in painting, new and graceful
forms of art were emerging. Painting was not the
grand art of other days; it might be small and
trivial, but there grew up a real little Renaissance
of the eighteenth century, full of originality and
fire, and showing a reaction from the pompous
and banale style of the imitators.</p>

<p>The influence of the &ldquo;lady&rdquo; was becoming
increasingly felt by society. Confidential little
boudoirs, small and cosy apartments were the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>mode, and needed decorating as well as vast
salas. The dainty luxury of gilt furniture,
designed by Andrea Brustolon and upholstered
in delicate silks, was matched by small, attractive
works of art. Venice had lost her Eastern trade,
and as the East faded out of her scheme of life,
the West, to which she now turned, was bringing
her a different form of art. The great reception
rooms were still suited by the grandiose compositions
of Ricci, Piazetta, and Pittoni, but
another genre of charming creations smiled
from the brocaded alcoves and more intimate
suites of rooms.</p>

<p>It is impossible to name more than a fraction
of these artists of the eighteenth century. There
is Amigoni, admirable as a portrait-painter;
Pittoni, one of the ablest figure-painters of the
day; Luca Carlevaris, the forerunner of Canale;
Pellegrini, whose decorations in this country are
mentioned by Horace Walpole and of which the
most important are preserved in the cupola and
spandrils of the Grand Hall at Castle Howard.
Their work is still to be found in many a
Venetian church or North Italian gallery. Some
of it is almost fine, though too often vitiated by
the affected, exaggerated spirit of their day.
When originality asserts itself more decidedly,
Rosalba Carriera stands out as an artist who
acquired great popularity. In 1700, when she
was a young woman of twenty-four, she was
already a great favourite with the public. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>began life as a lace-maker, but when trade was
bad, Jean St&egrave;ve, a Frenchman, taught her to
paint miniatures. She imparted a wonderfully
delicate feeling to her art, and, passing on to
pastel, she brought to this branch of portraiture
a brilliancy and freshness which it had not
known before. Rosalba has perhaps preserved
for us better than any one else, those women
of Venice who floated so lightly on the dancing
waves of that sparkling stream. There they
are: La Cornaro; La Maria Labia, who was
surrounded by French lovers, &ldquo;very courteous
and very beautiful&rdquo;; La Zenobio and La Pisani;
La Foscari, with her black plumes; La Mocenigo,
&ldquo;the lady with the pearls.&rdquo; She has pinned
them all to the canvas; lovely, frail, light-hearted
butterflies, with velvet neck-ribbons
round their snowy throats and coquettish patches
on their delicate skin and bouquets of flowers in
their high-dressed hair and sheeny bodices. They
look at us with arch eyes and smile with melting
mouths, more frivolous than depraved; sweet,
ephemeral, irresponsible in every relation of life.
Older men and women there are, too, when those
artificial years have produced a succession of
rather dull, sodden personages, kindly, inoffensive,
but stupid, and still trifling heavily with the
world.</p>

<p>Of Rosalba we have another picture to compare
with those of her sitters. She and the
other artists of her circle lived the merry, busy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>life of the worker, and found in their art the
antidote to the evil living and the dissipation of
the gay world which provided sitters and patrons.
Rosalba&#8217;s <em>milieu</em> is a type of others of its class.
She lives with her mother and sisters, an honest,
cheerful, industrious existence. They are fond
of old friends and old books, and indulge in music
and simple pleasures. Her sisters help Rosalba
by preparing the groundwork of her paintings.
She pays visits, and writes rhymes, and plays on
the harpsichord. She receives great men without
much ceremony, and the Elector Palatine, the
Duke of Mecklenburg, Frederick, King of
Norway, and Maximilian, King of Bavaria, come
to her to order miniatures of their reigning
beauties. Then she goes off to Paris where she
has plenty of commissions, and the frequently
occurring names of English patrons in her fragmentary
diaries, tell how much her work was
admired by English travellers. She did more
than anybody else to promote the fashion for
pastels, and her delightful art may be seen at its
best in the pastel room of the Dresden Gallery.</p>

<p>Henrietta, Countess of Pomfret, has left us
a charming description of a party of English
travellers, which included Horace Walpole,
arriving in Venice in 1741, strolling about in
mask and <em>bauta</em>, and visiting the famous pastellist
in her studio. It is in such guise that Rosalba
has painted Walpole, and has left one of the
most interesting examples of her art.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>TIEPOLO</strong></p>


<p>We have already noted that to establish the
significance of any period in art, it is necessary
that the tendencies should unite and combine in
some culminating spirits who rise triumphant
over their contemporaries and soar above the
age in which they live. Such a genius stands
out above the eighteenth century crowd, and is
not only of his century, but of every time. For
two hundred years Tiepolo has been stigmatised
as extravagant, mannered, as just equal to painting
cupids, nymphs, and parroquets. In the last
century he experienced the effect of the profound
discredit into which the whole of eighteenth-century
art had fallen. In France, David had
obliterated Watteau; and the reputation of
Pompeo Battoni, a sort of Italian David, effaced
Tiepolo and his contemporaries. When the
delegates of the French Republic inspected Italian
churches and palaces, and decided what works of
art should be sent to the Louvre, they singled
out the Bolognese, the Guercinos and Guidos,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>the Carracci, even Pompeo Battoni and other
such forgotten masters, a Gatti, a Nevelone, a
Badalocchio; but to the lasting regret of their
descendants, they disdained to annex a single one
of the great paintings of the Venetian, Gianbattista
Tiepolo.</p>

<p>Eastlake only vouchsafes him one line as &ldquo;an
artist of fantastic imagination.&rdquo; Most of the
nineteenth-century critics do not even mention
him. Burckhardt dismisses him with a grudging
line of praise, Blanc is equally disparaging, and
for Taine he is a mere mannerist, yet his
influence has been felt far beyond his lifetime;
only now is he coming into his own, and it is
recognised that the <em>plein-air</em> artist, the luminarist,
the impressionist, owe no small share of their
knowledge to his inspiration.</p>

<p>The name of Tiepolo brings before us a
whole string of illustrious personages&mdash;doges
and senators, magnificent procurators and great
captains&mdash;but we have nothing to prove that the
artist belonged to a decayed branch of the famous
patrician house. Born in Castello, the people&#8217;s
quarter of Venice, he studied in early youth
with that good draughtsman, Lazzarini. At
twenty-three he married the sister of Francesco
Guardi; Guardi, who comes between Longhi
and Canale and who is a better painter than
either. Tiepolo appeared at a fortunate moment.
The demand for a facile, joyous genius was at
its height. The life of the aristocracy on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>lagoons was every year growing more gay,
more abandoned to capricious inclination, to
light loves and absurd amusements. And the
art which reflected this life was called upon to
give gaiety rather than thought, costume rather
than character. Yet if the Venetian art had lost
all connection with the grave magnificence of
the past, it had kept aloof from the academic
coldness which was in fashion beyond the
lagoons, so that though theatrical, it was with a
certain natural absurdity. The age had become
romantic; the Arcadian convention was in full
force, Nature herself was pressed into the service
of idle, sentimental men and women. The
country was pictured as a place of delight,
where the sun always shone and the peasants
passed their time singing madrigals and indulging
in rural pleasures. The public, however, had
begun to look for beauty; the traditions which
had formed round the decorative schools were
giving way to the appreciation of original work.
Tiepolo, sincere and spontaneous even when
he is sacrificing truth to caprice, struck the
taste of the Venetians, and without emancipating
himself from the tendencies of the time, contrives
to introduce a fresh accent. All round
him was a weak and self-indulgent world, but
within himself he possessed a fund of buoyant
and inexhaustible energy. He evokes a throng
of personages on the ceilings of the churches
and palaces confided to his fancy. His creations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>range from mythology to religion, from
the sublime to the grotesque. All Olympia
appears upon his ample and luminous spaces.
It is not to the cold, austere Lazzarini, or to
the clashing chiaroscuro of Piazetta, or the
imaginative spirit of Battista Ricci, though he
was touched by each of them, that we must turn
for Tiepolo&#8217;s derivation. Long before his time,
the kind of decoration of ceilings which we
are apt to call Tiepolesque; the foreshortened
architecture, the columns and cornices, the figures
peopling the edifices, or reclining upon clouds,
had been used by an increasing throng of painters.
The style arose, indeed, in the quattrocento;
Mantegna, the Umbrians, and even Michelangelo
had used it, though in a far more sober way than
later generations. Correggio and the Venetians
had perfected the idea, which the artists of the
seventeenth century seized upon and carried
to the most intemperate excess. But Tiepolo
rose above them all; he abandoned the heavy,
exaggerated, contorted designs, which by this
time defied all laws of equilibrium, and we
must go back further than his immediate predecessors
for his origins. His claim to stand
with Tintoretto or Veronese may be contested,
but he is nearest to these, and no doubt Veronese
is the artist he studied with the greatest fervour.
Without copying, he seems to have a natural
affinity of spirit with Veronese and assimilates
the ample arrangement of his groups, the grace
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>of his architecture, and his decorative feeling for
colour. Zanetti, who was one of Tiepolo&#8217;s dearest
friends, writes: &ldquo;No painter of our time could
so well recall the bright and happy creations
of Veronese.&rdquo; The difference between them is
more one of period than of temperament. Paolo
Veronese represented the opulence of a rich,
strong society, full of noble life, while Tiepolo&#8217;s
lot was cast among effeminate men and frivolous
women, and full of the modern spirit himself,
he adapts his genius to his time and devotes
himself to satisfy the theatrical, sentimental
vein of the Venice of the decadence. Full
of enthusiasm for his work, he was ready to
respond to any call. He went to and fro between
Venice and the villas along the mainland
and to the neighbouring towns. Then coveting
wider fields, he travelled to Milan and Genoa,
where his frescoes still gleam in the palaces
of the Dugnani, the Archinto, and the Clerici.
At W&uuml;rzburg in Bavaria he achieved a magnificent
series of decorations for the palace of the
Prince-Archbishop. Then coming back to Italy,
he painted altarpieces, portraits, pictures for his
friends, and a fresh multitude of allegorical and
mythological frescoes in palaces and villas. His
charming villa at Zianigo is frescoed from top
to bottom by himself and his sons, and has
amusing examples of contemporary dress and
manners.</p>

<p>When the Academy was instituted in 1755,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>Tiepolo was appointed its first director, but the
sort of employment it provided was not suited
to his impetuous spirit, and in 1762 he threw
up the post and went off to Spain with his two
sons. There he received a splendid welcome
and was loaded with commissions, the only
dissentient voice being that of Raphael Mengs,
who, obsessed by the taste for the classic and the
antique, was fiercely opposed to the Venetian&#8217;s
art. Tiepolo died suddenly in Madrid in 1770,
pencil in hand. Though he was past seventy,
the frescoes he has left there show that his
hand was as firm and his eye as sure as ever.</p>

<p>His frescoes have, as we have said, that
frankly theatrical flavour which corresponds
exactly to the taste of the time. Such works
as the &ldquo;Transportation of the Holy House of
Loretto&rdquo; in the Church of the Scalzi in Venice,
or the &ldquo;Triumph of Faith&rdquo; in that of the
Piet&agrave;, the &ldquo;Triumph of Hercules&rdquo; in Palazzo
Canossa in Verona, or the decorations in the
magnificent villa of the Pisani at Str&agrave;, are
extravagant and fantastic, yet have the impressive
quality of genius. These last, which have for
subject the glorification of the Pisani, are full
of portraits. The patrician sons and daughters
appear, surrounded by Abundance, War, and
Wisdom. A woman holding a sceptre symbolises
Europe. All round are grouped flags and
dragons, &ldquo;nations grappling in the airy blue,&rdquo;
bands of Red Indians in their war-paint and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>happy couples making love. The idea of the
history, the wealth, the supreme dignity of the
House is paramount, and over all appears Fame,
bearing the noble name into immortality. In
Palazzo Clerici at Milan a rich and prodigal
committee gave the painter a free hand, and on
the ceiling of a vast hall the Sun in a chariot,
with four horses harnessed abreast, rises to the
meridian, flooding the world with light. Venus
and Saturn attend him, and his advent is heralded
by Mercury. A symbolical figure of the earth
joys at his coming, and a concourse of naiads,
nymphs, and dolphins wait upon his footsteps.
In the school of the Carmine in Venice Tiepolo
has left one of his grandest displays. The
haughty Queen of Heaven, who is his ideal of
the Virgin, bears the Child lightly on her arm,
and, standing enthroned upon the rolling clouds,
hardly deigns to acknowledge the homage of
the prostrate saint, on whom an attendant angel
is bestowing her scapulary. The most charming
<em>amoretti</em> are disporting in all directions, flinging
themselves from on high in delicious <em>abandon</em>,
alternating with lovely groups of the cardinal
virtues. At Villa Valmarana near Vicenza, after
revelling among the gods, he comes to earth
and delights in painting lovely ladies with
almond eyes and carnation cheeks, attended by
their cavaliers, seated in balconies, looking on
at a play, or dancing minuets, and carnival
scenes with masques and dominoes and <em>f&ecirc;tes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>champ&ecirc;tres</em>, which give us a picture of the
fashions and manners of the day. He brings in
groups of Chinese in oriental dress, and then
he condescends to paint country girls and their
rustic swains, in the style of Phyllis and
Corydon.</p>

<p>Sometimes he becomes graver and more solid.
He abandons the airy fancies scattered in cloud-land.
The story of Esther in Palazzo Dugnano
affords an opportunity for introducing magnificent
architecture, warriors in armour, and stately
dames in satin and brocades. He touches his
highest in the decorations of Palazzo Labia,
where Antony and Cleopatra, seated at their
banquet, surrounded by pomp and revelry, regard
one another silently, with looks of sombre
passion. Four exquisite panels have lately been
acquired by the Brera Gallery, representing the
loves of Rinaldo and Armida, and are a feast
of gay, delicate colour, with fascinating backgrounds
of Italian gardens. The throne-room
of the palace at Madrid has the same order of
compositions&mdash;&AElig;neas conducted by Venus from
Time to Immortality, and other deifications of
Spanish royalty.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption"><em>Tiepolo.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Palazzo Labia, Venice.</em></p>

<p>Now and then Tiepolo is possessed by a
tragic mood. In the Church of San Alvise he
has left a &ldquo;Way to Calvary,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Flagellation,&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;Crowning of Thorns,&rdquo; which are intensely
dramatic, and which show strong feeling.
Particularly striking is the contrast between the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>refined and sensitive type of his Christ and the
realistic and even brutal study of the two
despairing malefactors&mdash;one a common ruffian,
the other an aged offender of a higher class.
His altarpiece at Este, representing S. Tecla
staying the plague, is painted with a real insight
into disaster and agony, and S. Tecla is a
pathetic and beautiful figure. Sometimes in his
easel-pictures he paints a Head of Christ, a
S. Anthony, or a Crucifixion, but he always
returns before long to the ample spaces and
fantastic subjects which his soul loved.</p>

<p>Tiepolo is a singular contradiction. His art
suggests a strong being, held captive by butterflies.
Sometimes he is joyous and limpid, sometimes
turbulent and strong, but he has always
sincerity, force, and life. A great space serves
to exhilarate him, and he asks nothing better
than to cover it with angels and goddesses, white
limbs among the clouds, sea-horses ridden by
Tritons, patrician warriors in Roman armour,
balustrades and columns and <em>amoretti</em>. He does
not even need to pounce his design, but puts in
all sorts of improvised modifications with a sure
hand. The vastness of his frescoes, the daring
poses of his countless figures, and the freedom of
his line speak eloquently of the mastery to
which his hand had attained. He revels, above
all, in effects of light&mdash;&ldquo;all the light of the
sky, and all the light of the sea; all the light
of Venice ... in which he swims as in a bath.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>He paints not ideas, scarcely even forms, but
light. His ceilings are radiant, like the sky
of birds; his poems seem to be written in the
clouds. Light is fairer than all things, and
Tiepolo knows all the tricks and triumphs of
light.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Nearly all his compositions have a serene
and limpid horizon, with the figures approaching
it painted in clear, silvery hues, airy and
diaphanous, while the forms below are more
muscular, the flesh tints are deeper, and the
whole of the foreground is often enveloped in
shadow. Veronese had lit up the shadows,
which, under his contemporaries, were growing
gloomy. Tiepolo carries his art further on the
same lines. He makes his figures more graceful,
his draperies more vaporous, and illumines
his clouds with radiance. His faded blue and
rose, his golden-greys, and pearly whites and
pastel tints are not so much solid colours as
caprices of light. We have remarked already
that with Veronese the accessories of gleaming
satins and rich brocades serve to obscure the
persons. In many of Tiepolo&#8217;s scenes the
figures are lost in a flutter of drapery, subject
and action melt away, and we are only conscious
of soft harmonies of delicious colour,
as ethereal as the hues of spring flowers in
woodland ways and joyous meadows. With
these delicious, audacious fancies, put on with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>a nervous hand, we forget the age of profound and
ardent passion, we escape from that of pompous
solemnity and studied grace, and we breathe
an atmosphere of irresponsible and capricious
pleasure. In this last word of her great masters
Venice keeps what her temperament loved&mdash;sensuous
colour and emotional chiaroscuro, used
to accentuate an art adapted to a city of pleasure.</p>

<p>The excellence of the old masters&#8217; drawings
is a perpetual revelation. Even second-class
men are almost invariably fine draughtsmen,
proving that drawing was looked upon as something
over which it was necessary for even the
meanest to have entire mastery. Tiepolo&#8217;s
drawings, preserved in Venice and in various
museums, are as beautiful as can be wished;
perfect in execution and vivid in feeling. In
Venice are twenty or thirty sheets in red carbon,
of flights of angels, and of draperies studied in
every variety of fold.</p>

<p>Poor work of his school is often ascribed to
his sons, but the superb &ldquo;Stations of the Cross,&rdquo;
in the Frari, which were etched by Domenico,
and published as his own in his lifetime, are
almost equal to the father&#8217;s work. Tiepolo had
many immediate followers and imitators. The
colossal roof-painting of Fabio Canal in the
Church of SS. Apostoli, Venice, may be pointed
out as an example of one of these. But he is full
of the tendencies of modern art. Mr. Berenson,
writing of him, says he sometimes seems more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>the first than the last of a line, and notices how
he influenced many French artists of recent
times, though none seem quite to have caught
the secret of his light intensity and his exquisite
caprice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>PIETRO LONGHI</strong></p>


<p>We have here a master who is peculiarly the
Venetian of the eighteenth century, a genre-painter
whose charm it is not easy to surpass,
yet one who did not at the outset find his true
vocation. Longhi&#8217;s first undertakings, specimens
of which exist in certain palaces in Venice, were
elaborate frescoes, showing the baneful influence
of the Bolognese School, in which he studied
for a time under Giuseppe Crispi. He attempts
to place the deities of Olympus on his ceilings
in emulation of Tiepolo, but his Juno is heavy
and common, and the Titans at her feet appear
as a swarm of sprawling, ill-drawn nudities. He
shows no faculty for this kind of work, but he
was thirty-two before he began to paint those
small easel-pictures which in his own dainty style
illustrate the &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo; of his period, and in
which the eighteenth century lives for us again.</p>

<p>His earliest training was in the goldsmith&#8217;s
art, and he has left many drawings of plate,
exquisite in their sense of graceful curve and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>their unerring precision of line. It was a
moment when such things acquired a flawless
purity of outline, and Longhi recognised their
beauty with all the sensitive perception of the
artist and the practised workman. His studies
of draperies, gestures, and hands are also extraordinarily
careful, and he seems besides to have
an intimate acquaintance with all the elegant
dissipation and languid excesses of a dying order.
We feel that he has himself been at home in
the masquerade, has accompanied the lady to
the fortune-teller, and, leaning over her graceful
shoulder, has listened to the soothsayer&#8217;s murmurs.
He has attended balls and routs, danced minuets,
and gossiped over tiny cups of China tea. He
is the last chronicler of the Venetian feasts,
and with him ends that long series that began
with Giorgione&#8217;s concert and which developed
and passed through suppers at Cana and banquets
at the houses of Levi and the Pharisee. We
are no longer confronted with the sumptuosity
of Bonifazio and Veronese; the immense tables
covered with gold and silver plate, the long
lines of guests robed in splendid brocades, the
stream of servants bearing huge salvers, or the
bands of musicians, nor are there any more
alfresco concerts, with nymphs and bacchantes.
Instead there are masques, the life of the Ridotto
or gaming-house, routs and intrigues in dainty
boudoirs, and surreptitious love-making in that
city of eternal carnival where the <em>bauta</em> was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>almost a national costume. Longhi holds that
post which in French art is filled by Watteau,
Fragonard, and Lancret, the painters of <em>f&ecirc;tes
galantes</em>, and though he cannot be placed on
an equal footing with those masters, he is
representative and significant enough. On his
canvases are preserved for us the mysteries of
the toilet, over which ladies and young men
of fashion dawdled through the morning, the
drinking of chocolate in <em>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</em>, the momentous
instants spent in choosing headgear and fixing
patches, the towers of hair built by the modish
coiffeur&mdash;children trooping in, in hoops and
uniforms, to kiss their mother&#8217;s hand, the fine
gentleman choosing a waistcoat and ogling the
pretty embroideress, the pert young maidservant
slipping a billet-doux into a beauty&#8217;s hand under
her husband&#8217;s nose, the old beau toying with
a fan, or the discreet abb&eacute; taking snuff over the
morning gazette. The grand ladies of Longhi&#8217;s
day pay visits in hoop and farthingale, the beaux
make &ldquo;a leg,&rdquo; and the lacqueys hand chocolate.
The beautiful Venetians and their gallants swim
through the gavotte or gamble in the Ridotto,
or they hasten to assignations, disguised in wide
<em>bauti</em> and carrying preposterous muffs. The
Correr Museum contains a number of his
paintings and also his book of original sketches.
One of the most entertaining of his canvases
represents a visit of patricians to a nuns&#8217; parlour.
The nuns and their pupils lend an attentive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>ear to the whispers of the world. Their dresses
are trimmed with <em>point de Venise</em>, and a little
theatre is visible in the background. This and
the &ldquo;Sala del Ridotto&rdquo; which hangs near, are
marked by a free, bold handling, a richness of
colouring, and more animation than is usual in
his genre-pictures. He has not preserved the
lovely, indeterminate colour or the impressionist
touch which was the natural inheritance of
Watteau or Tiepolo. His backgrounds are dark
and heavy, and he makes too free a use of
body colour; but his attitude is one of close
observation&mdash;he enjoys depicting the life around
him, and we suspect that he sees in it the most
perfect form of social intercourse imaginable.
Longhi is sometimes called the Goldoni of
painting, and he certainly more nearly resembles
the genial, humorous playwright than he does
Hogarth, to whom he has also been compared.
Yet his execution and technique are a little
like Hogarth&#8217;s, and it is possible that he was
influenced by the elder and stronger master,
who entered on his triumphant career as a
satirical painter of society about 1734. This
was just the time when Longhi abandoned his
unlucky decorative style, and it is quite possible
that he may have met with engravings of the
&ldquo;Marriage &agrave; la mode,&rdquo; and was stimulated by
them to the study of eighteenth-century manners,
though his own temperament is far removed
from Hogarth&#8217;s moral force and grim satire.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>His serene, painstaking observation is never
distracted by grossness and violence. The
Venetians of his day may have been&mdash;undoubtedly
were&mdash;effeminate, licentious, and decadent,
but they were kind and gracious, of
refined manners, well-bred, genial and intelligent,
and so Longhi has transcribed them. In the
time which followed, ceilings were covered by
Boucher, pastels by Latour were in demand,
the scholars of David painted classical scenes,
and Pietro Longhi was forgotten. Antonio
Francesco Correr bought five hundred of his
drawings from his son, Alessandro, but his
works were ignored and dispersed. The classic
and romantic fashions passed, but it was only
in 1850 that the brothers de Goncourt, writing
on art, revived consideration for the painter of a
bygone generation. Many of his works are in
private collections, especially in England, but few
are in public galleries. The National Gallery is
fortunate in possessing several excellent examples.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>CANALE</strong></p>


<p>While Piazetta and Tiepolo were proving
themselves the inheritors of the great school
of decorators, Venice herself was finding her
chroniclers, and a school of landscape arose, of
which Canale was the foremost member. Giovanni
Antonio Canale was born in Venice in
1697, the same year as Tiepolo. His father
earned his living at the profession, lucrative
enough just then, of scene-painting, and Antonio
learned to handle his brush, working at his side.
In 1719 he went off to seek his fortune in Rome,
and though he was obliged to help out his
resources by his early trade, he was most concerned
in the study of architecture, ancient and
modern. Rome spoke to him through the eye,
by the picturesque masses of stonework, the
warm harmonious tones of classic remains and
the effects of light upon them. He painted
almost entirely out-of-doors, and has left many
examples drawn from the ruins. His success
in Rome was not remarkable, and he was still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>a very young man when he retraced his steps.
On regaining his native town, he realised for the
first time the beauty of its canals and palaces,
and he never again wavered in his allegiance.</p>

<p>Two rivals were already in the field, Luca
Carlevaris, whose works were freely bought by
the rich Venetians, and Marco Ricci, the figures
in whose views of Venice were often touched
in by his uncle, Sebastiano; but Canale&#8217;s growing
fame soon dethroned them, &ldquo;i cacciati del nido,&rdquo;
as he said, using Dante&#8217;s expression. In a
generation full of caprice, delighting in sensational
developments, Canale was methodical to
a fault, and worked steadily, calmly producing
every detail of Venetian landscape with untiring
application and almost monotonous tranquillity.
He lived in the midst of a band of painters who
adored travel. Sebastiano Ricci was always on
the move; Tiepolo spent much of his time in
other cities and countries, and passed the last
years of his life in Spain; Pietro Rotari was
attached to the Court of St. Petersburg; Belotto,
Canale&#8217;s nephew, settled in Bohemia; but Canale
remained at home, and, except for two short
visits paid to England, contented himself with
trips to Padua and Verona.</p>

<p>Early in life Canale entered into relations
with Joseph Smith, the British Consul in Venice,
a connoisseur who had not only formed a fine
collection of pictures, but had a gallery from
which he was very ready to sell to travellers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>He bought of the young Venetian at a very
low price, and contrived, unfairly enough, to
acquire the right to all his work for a certain
period of time, with the object of sending it, at
a good profit, to London. For a time Canale&#8217;s
luminous views were bought by the English
under these auspices, but the artist, presently
discovering that he was making a bad bargain,
came over to England, where he met with an
encouraging reception, especially at Windsor
Castle and from the Duke of Richmond. Canale
spent two years in England and painted on the
Thames and at Cambridge, but he could not
stand the English climate and fled from the
damp and fogs to his own lagoons.</p>

<p>To describe his paintings is to describe Venice
at every hour of the day and night&mdash;Venice
with its long array of noble palaces, with its
Grand Canal and its narrow, picturesque waterways.
He reproduces the Venice we know, and
we see how little it has changed. The gondolas
cluster round the landing-stages of the Piazzetta,
the crowds hurry in and out of the arcades of
the Ducal Palace, or he paints the festivals
that still retained their splendour: the Great
Bucentaur leaving the Riva dei Schiavoni on
the Feast of the Ascension, or San Geremia and
the entrance to the Cannaregio decked in flags
for a feast-day. From one end to another of
the Grand Canal, that &ldquo;most beautiful street
in the world,&rdquo; as des Commines called it in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>1495, we can trace every aspect of Canale&#8217;s
time, when the city had as yet lost nothing of
its splendour or its animation. At the entrance
stands S. Maria della Salute, that sanctuary dear
to Venetian hearts, built as a votive offering
after the visitation of the plague in 1631. Its
flamboyant dome, with its volutes, its population
of stone saints, its green bronze door catching
the light, pleased Canale, as it pleased Sargent
in our own day, and he painted it over and
over again. The annual f&ecirc;te of the Confraternity
of the Carit&agrave; takes place at the Scuola di San
Rocco, and Canale paints the old Renaissance
building which shelters so much of Tintoretto&#8217;s
finest work, decorated with ropes of greenery
and gay with flags,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> while Tiepolo has put in
the red-robed, periwigged councillors and the
gazing populace. Near it in the National
Gallery hangs a &ldquo;Regatta&rdquo; with its array of
boats, its shouting gondoliers, and its shadows
lying across the range of palaces, and telling
the exact hour of the day that it was sketched
in; or, again, the painter has taken peculiar
pleasure in expressing quiet days, with calm
green waters and wide empty piazzas, divided by
sun and shadow, with a few citizens plodding
about their business in the hot midday, or a
quiet little abb&eacute; crossing the piazza on his way
to Mass. Canale has made a special study of the
light on wall and fa&ccedil;ade, and of the transparent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>waters of the canals and the azure skies in which
float great snowy fleeces.</p>

<p>His second visit to England was paid in
1751. He was received with open arms by
the great world, and invited to the houses of the
nobility in town and country. The English
were delighted with his taste and with the
mastery with which he painted architectural
scenes, and in spite of advancing years he produced
a number of compositions, which commanded
high prices. The Garden of Vauxhall,
the Rotunda at Ranelagh, Whitehall, Northumberland
House, Eton College, were some of the
subjects which attracted him, and the treatment
of which was signalised by his calm and perfect
balance. He made use of the camera ottica,
which is in principal identical with the camera
oscura. Lanzi says he amended its defects and
taught its proper use, but it must be confessed
that in the careful perspective of some of his
scenes, its traces seem to haunt us and to convey
a certain cold regularity. Canale was a marvellous
engraver. Mantegna, Bellini, and Titian
had placed engraving on a very high level in the
Venetian School, and though at a later date it
became too elaborate, Tiepolo and his son brought
it back to simplicity. Canale aided them, and
his <em>eaux-fortes</em>, of which he has left about thirty,
are filled with light and breadth of treatment,
and he is particularly happy in his brilliant,
transparent water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p><p>The high prices Canale obtained for his
pictures in his lifetime led to the usual
imitations. He was surrounded by painters
whose whole ambition was limited to copying
him. Among these were Marieschi, Visentini,
Colombini, besides others now forgotten. More
than fifty of his finest works were bought
by Smith for George III. and fill a room at
Windsor. He was made a member of the
Academy at Dresden, and Bruhl, the Prime
Minister of the Elector, obtained from him
twenty-one works which now adorn the gallery
there. Canale died in Venice, where he had
lived nearly all his life, and where his gondola-studio
was a familiar object in the Piazzetta, at
the Lido, or anchored in the long canals.</p>

<p>His nephew, Bernardo Belotto, is often also
called Canaletto, and it seems that both uncle and
nephew were equally known by the diminutive.
Belotto, too, went to Rome early in his career,
where he attached himself to Panini, a painter
of classic ruins, peopled with warriors and
shepherds. He was, by all accounts, full of
vanity and self-importance, and on a visit to
Germany managed to acquire the title of Count,
which he adhered to with great complacency.
He travelled all over Italy looking for patronage,
and was very eager to find the road to success and
fortune. About the same time as his uncle, he
paid a visit to London and was patronised by
Horace Walpole, but in the full tide of success
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>he was summoned to Dresden, where the Elector,
disappointed at not having secured the services
of the uncle, was fain to console himself with
those of the nephew. The extravagant and
profligate Augustus II., whose one idea was to
extract money by every possible means from
his subjects, in order to adorn his palaces, was
consistently devoted to Belotto, who was in his
element as a Court painter. He paints all his
uncle&#8217;s subjects, and it is not always easy to
distinguish between the two; but his paintings
are dull and stiff as compared with those of
Canale, though he is sometimes fine in colour,
and many of his views are admirably drawn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>FRANCESCO GUARDI</strong></p>


<p>An entry in Gradenigo&#8217;s diary of 1764, preserved
in the Museo Correr, speaks of &ldquo;Francesco
Guardi, painter of the quarter of SS. Apostoli,
along the Fondamenta Nuove, a good pupil of
the famous Canaletto, having by the aid of the
camera ottica, most successfully painted two canvases
(not small) by the order of a stranger (an
Englishman), with views of the Piazza San
Marco, towards the Church and the Clock
Tower, and of the Bridge of the Rialto and
buildings towards the Cannaregio, and have
to-day examined them under the colonnades
of the Procurazie and met with universal
applause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Francesco Guardi was a son of the Austrian
Tyrol, and his mountain ancestry may account,
as in the case of Titian, for the freshness and
vigour of his art. Both his father, who settled
in Venice, and his brother were painters. His
son became one in due time, and the profession
being followed by four members of the family
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>accounts for the indifferent works often attributed
to Guardi.</p>

<p>His indebtedness to Canale is universally
acknowledged, and perhaps it is true that he
never attains to the monumental quality, the
traditional dignity which marks Canale out as
a great master, but he differs from Canale in
temperament, style, and technique. Canale is
a much more exact and serious student of
architectural detail; Guardi, with greater visible
vigour, obliterates detail, and has no hesitation
in drawing in buildings which do not really
appear. In his oval painting of the Ducal Palace
(Wallace Collection) he makes it much loftier
and more spacious than it really is. In his
&ldquo;Piazzetta&rdquo; he puts in a corner of the Loggia
where it would not actually be seen. In the
&ldquo;Fair in Piazza S. Marco&rdquo; the arch from under
which the Fair appears is gigantic, and he foreshortens
the wing of the royal palace. He curtails
the length of the columns in the piazza and so
avoids monotony of effect, and he often alters
the height of the campaniles he uses, making
them tall and slender or short and broad, as
his picture requires. At one time he produced
some colossal pictures, in several of which Mr.
Simonson, who has written an admirable life of
the painter, believes that the hand of Canale is
perceptible in collaboration; but it was not his
natural element, and he often became heavy in
colour and handling. In 1782 he undertook a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>commission from Pietro Edwards, who was a
noted connoisseur and inspector of State pictures,
and had been appointed superintendent in 1778 of
an official studio for the restoration of old masters.</p>

<p>Edwards had important dealings with Guardi,
who was directed to paint four leading incidents
in the rejoicings in honour of the visit of
Pius IV. to Venice. The Venetians themselves
had become indifferent patrons of art, but Venice
attracted great numbers of foreign visitors, and
before the second half of the eighteenth century
the export of old masters had already become
an established trade. There is no sign, however,
that Joseph Smith, who retained his consulship
till 1760, extended any patronage to Guardi,
though he enriched George III.&#8217;s collection
with works of the chief contemporary artists
of Venice. It is probable that Guardi had been
warned against him by Canale and profited by
the latter&#8217;s experience.</p>

<p>We can divide his work into three categories.
1. Views of Venice. 2. Public ceremonies.
3. Landscapes. Gradenigo mentions casually
that he used the camera ottica, but though we
may consider it probable, we cannot trace the
use of it in his works. He is not only a painter
of architecture, but pays great attention to light
and atmosphere, and aims at subtle effects; a
transparent haze floats over the lagoons, or the
sun pierces though the morning mists. His
four large pendants in the Wallace Collection
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>show his happiest efforts; light glances off the
water and is reflected on the shadowed walls.
His views round the Salute bring vividly before
us those delicious morning hours in Venice
when the green tide has just raced up the Grand
Canal, when a fresh wind is lifting and curling
all the loose sails and fluttering pennons, and
when the gondoliers are straining at the oars, as
their light craft is caught and blown from side
to side upon the rippling water. The sky
occupies much of his space, he makes searching
studies of it, and his favourite effect is a
flash of light shooting across a piled-up mass
of clouds. The line of the horizon is low, and
he exhibits great mastery in painting the wide
lagoons, but he also paints rough seas, and is
one of the few masters of his day&mdash;perhaps
the only one&mdash;who succeeds in representing a
storm at sea.</p>

<p>Often as he paints the same subjects he never
becomes mechanical or photographic. We may
sometimes tire of the monotony of Canale&#8217;s
unerring perspective and accurate buildings, but
Guardi always finds some new rendering, some
fresh point of interest. Sometimes he gives us
a summer day, when Venice stands out in light,
her white palaces reflected in the sun-illumined
water; sometimes he is arrested by old churches
bathed in shadow and fusing into the rich, dark
tones of twilight. His boats and figures are
introduced with great spirit and <em>brio</em>, and are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>alive with that handling which a French critic
has described as his <em>griffe endiabl&eacute;e</em>.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption"><em>Francesco Guardi.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S. MARIA DELLA SALUTE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>London.</em><br />
(<em>Photo, Mansell and Co.</em>)</p>

<p>His masterly and spirited painting of crowds
enables him to reproduce for us all those public
ceremonies which Venice retained as long as
the Republic lasted: yearly pilgrimages of the
Doge to Venetian churches, to the Salute to
commemorate the cessation of the plague, to
San Zaccaria on Easter Day, the solemn procession
on Corpus Christi Day, receptions of
ambassadors, and, most gorgeous of all, the Feast
of the Wedding of the Adriatic. He has faithfully
preserved the ancient ceremonial which
accompanied State festivities. In the &ldquo;F&ecirc;te
du Jeudi Gras&rdquo; (Louvre) he illustrates the acrobatic
feats which were performed before Doge
Mocenigo. A huge Temple of Victory is
erected on the Piazzetta, and gondoliers are seen
climbing on each other&#8217;s shoulders and dancing
upon ropes. His motley crowds show that the
whole population, patricians as well as people,
took part in the feasts. He has also left many
striking interiors: among others, that of the
Sala del Gran Consiglio, where sometimes as
many as a thousand persons were assembled, the
&ldquo;Reception of the Doge and Senate by Pius IV.&rdquo;
(which formed one of the series ordered by
Pietro Edwards), or the fine &ldquo;Interior of a
Theatre,&rdquo; exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts
in 1911, belonging to a series of which another
is at Munich.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p><p>In his landscapes Guardi does not pay very
faithful attention to nature. The landscape
painters of the eighteenth century, as Mr. Simonson
points out, were not animated by any very
genuine impulse to study nature minutely. It
was the picturesque element which appealed to
them, and they were chiefly concerned to reproduce
romantic features, grouped according to
fancy. Guardi composes half fantastic scenes,
introducing classic remains, triumphal arches,
airy Palladian monuments. His <em>capricci</em> include
compositions in which Roman ruins, overgrown
with foliage, occupy the foreground of a painting
of Venetian palaces, but in which the combination
is carried out with so much sparkle and
nervous life and such charm of style, that it is
attractive and piquant rather than grotesque.</p>

<p>England is richest in Guardis, of any country,
but France in one respect is better off, in possessing
no less than eleven fine paintings of public
ceremonials. Guardi may be considered the
originator of small sketches, and perhaps the
precursor of those glib little views which are
handed about the Piazza at the present day.
His drawings are fairly numerous, and are remarkably
delicate and incisive in touch. A
large collection which he left to his son is now
in the Museo Correr. In his later years he was
reduced to poverty and used to exhibit sketches
in the Piazza, parting with them for a few
ducats, and in this way flooding Venice with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>small landscapes. The exact spot occupied by
his <em>bottega</em> is said to be at the corner of the
Palazzo Reale, opposite the Clock Tower. The
house in which he died still exists in the
Campiello della Madonna, No. 5433, Parrocchia
S. Canziano, and has a shrine dedicated to the
Madonna attached to it. When quite an old
man, Guardi paid a visit to the home of his
ancestors, at Mastellano in the Austrian Tyrol,
and made a drawing of Castello Corvello on the
route. To this day his name is remembered
with pride in his Tyrolean valley.</p>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>


<p>It is an advantage to the student of Italian art to be able to
read French, German, and Italian, for though translations
appear of the most important works, there are many interesting
articles and monographs of minor artists which are otherwise
inaccessible.</p>

<p>Vasari, not always trustworthy, either in dates, facts, or
opinions, yet delightfully human in his histories, is indispensable,
and new editions and translations are constantly issued.
Sansoni&#8217;s edition (Florence), with Milanesi&#8217;s notes, is the most
authoritative; and for translations, those of Mrs. Foster (Messrs.
Blashfield and Hopkins), and a new edition in the Temple
classics (Dent, 8 vols., 2s. each vol.).</p>

<p>Ridolfi, the principal contemporary authority on Venetian
artists, who published his <em>Maraviglie dell&#8217; arte</em> nine years
after Domenico Tintoretto&#8217;s death, is only to be read in
Italian, though the anecdotes with which his work abounds
are made use of by every writer.</p>

<p>Crowe and Cavalcaselle&#8217;s <em>Painting in North Italy</em> (Murray)
is a storehouse of painstaking, minute, and, on the whole,
marvellously correct information and sound opinion. It supplies
a foundation, fills gaps, and supplements individual biographies
as no other book does. For the early painters, down to the
time of the Bellini, <em>I Origini dei pittori veneziani</em>, by Professor
Leonello Venturi, Venice, 1907, is a large book, written with
mastery and insight, and well illustrated; <em>La Storia della pittura
veneziana</em> is another careful work, which deals very minutely
with the early school of mosaics.</p>

<p>In studying the Bellini, the late Mr. S. A. Strong has <em>The
Brothers Bellini</em> (Bell&#8217;s Great Masters), and the reader should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>not fail to read Mr. Roger Fry&#8217;s <em>Bellini</em> (Artist&#8217;s Library), a
scholarly monograph, short but reliable, and full of suggestion
and appreciation, though written in a cool, critical spirit.
Dr. Hills has dealt ably with <em>Pisanello</em> (Duckworth).</p>

<p>Molmenti and Ludwig in their monumental work <em>Vittore
Carpaccio</em>, translated by Mr. R. H. Cust (Murray, 1907), and
Paul Kristeller in the equally important <em>Mantegna</em>, translated
by Mr. S. A. Strong (Longmans, 1901), seem to have exhausted
all that there is to be said for the moment concerning these
two painters.</p>

<p>It is almost superfluous to mention Mr. Berenson&#8217;s two
well-known volumes, <em>The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance</em>,
and the <em>North Italian Painters of the Renaissance</em> (Putnam).
They are brilliant essays which supplement every other work,
overflowing with suggestive and critical matter, supplying
original thoughts, and summing up in a few pregnant words
the main features and the tendencies of the succeeding stages.</p>

<p>In studying Giorgione, we cannot dispense with Pater&#8217;s
essay, included in <em>The Renaissance</em>. The author is not always
well informed as to facts&mdash;he wrote in the early days of criticism&mdash;but
he is rich in idea and feeling. Mr. Herbert Cook&#8217;s <em>Life
of Giorgione</em> (Bell&#8217;s Great Masters) is full and interesting.
Some authorities question his attributions as being too
numerous, but whether we regard them as authentic works of
the master or as belonging to his school, the illustrations he
gives add materially to our knowledge of the Giorgionesque.</p>

<p>When we come to Titian we are well off. Crowe and
Cavalcaselle&#8217;s <em>Life of Titian</em> (Murray, out of print), in two
large volumes, is well written and full of good material, from
which subsequent writers have borrowed. An excellent Life,
full of penetrating criticism, by Mr. C. Ricketts, was lately
brought out by Methuen (Classics of Art), complete with
illustrations, and including a minute analysis of Titian&#8217;s technique.
Sir Claude Phillips&#8217;s Monograph on Titian will appeal
to every thoughtful lover of the painter&#8217;s genius, and Dr.
Gronau has written a good and scholarly Life (Duckworth).</p>

<p>Mr. Berenson&#8217;s <em>Lorenzo Lotto</em> must be read for its interest
and learning, given with all the author&#8217;s charm and lucidity.
It includes an essay on Alvise Vivarini.</p>

<p>My own <em>Tintoretto</em> (Methuen, Classics of Art) gives a full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>account of the man and his work, and especially deals exhaustively
with the scheme and details of the Scuola di San Rocco.
Professor Thode has written a detailed and profusely illustrated
Life of Tintoretto in the Knackfuss Series, and the Paradiso has
been treated at length and illustrated in great detail in a very
scholarly <em>&eacute;dition de luxe</em> by Mr. F. O. Osmaston. It is the
fashion to discard Ruskin, but though we may allow that his
judgments are exaggerated, that he reads more into a picture
than the artist intended, and that he is too fond of preaching
sermons, there are few critics who have so many ideas to give
us, or who are so informed with a deep love of art, and both
<em>Modern Painters</em> and the <em>Stones of Venice</em> should be read.</p>

<p>M. Charles Yriarte has written a Life of Paolo Veronese,
which is full of charm and knowledge. It is interesting to
take a copy of Boschini&#8217;s <em>Della pittura veneziana</em>, 1797, when
visiting the galleries, the palaces, and the churches of Venice.
His lists of the pictures, as they were known in his day, often
open our eyes to doubtful attributions. Second-hand copies
of Boschini are not difficult to pick up. When the later-century
artists are reached, a good sketch of the Venice of
their period is supplied by Philippe Monnier&#8217;s delightful <em>Venice
in the Eighteenth Century</em> (Chatto and Windus), which also
has a good chapter on the lesser Venetian masters. The best
Life of Tiepolo is in Italian, by Professor Pompeo Molmenti.
The smaller masters have to be hunted for in many scattered
essays; a knowledge of Goldoni adds point to Longhi&#8217;s pictures.
Canaletto and his nephew, Belotto, have been treated by
M. Uzanne, <em>Les Deux Canaletto</em>; and Mr. Simonson has written
an important and charming volume on Francesco Guardi
(Methuen, 1904), with beautiful reproductions of his works.
Among other books which give special information are
Morelli&#8217;s two volumes, <em>Italian Painters in Borghese and Doria
Pamphili</em>, and <em>In Dresden and Munich Galleries</em>, translated by
Miss Jocelyn ffoulkes (Murray); and Dr. J. P. Richter&#8217;s
magnificent catalogue of the Mond Collection&mdash;which, though
published at fifteen guineas, can be seen in the great art libraries&mdash;has
some valuable chapters on the Venetian masters.</p>

It is this quality of unarrested movement, so conspicuous
above all in the figure of Bacchus, which attracts us irresistibly in
the Huntress, in Lord Brownlow&#8217;s &ldquo;Diana and Actaeon.&rdquo;
The construction of the form of the goddess in this beautiful but
little-known picture is admirable. Worn as the colour is, appearing
almost as a monochrome, the landscape is full of atmospheric
suggestion. It is in Titian&#8217;s latest manner, and its ample lines and
free unimpeded motion can be due to no inferior brush.</p></div>

Andrea Meldola, the Sclavonian, a native of Dalmatia, landing
in Venice, had a great struggle for existence. He drew from
Parmegianino, and studied Giorgione and Titian. He was probably
an assistant of Titian, and helped him, as in the &ldquo;Venus and
Adonis&rdquo; of the National Gallery, which owes much to his hand.
He fails conspicuously in form, his shadows are black, and his
figures often vulgar, but he has a fine sense of colour, and a free,
crisp touch. He was one of the young masters who flooded Venice
with light, sketchy wares.</p></div>
